[21.July 2009]
- menu/menus.rb: made "gems resistent"; changed label of the second Credits
- menu/items/textview.rb: started development of new widget (shows long text)

[2.February 2009]
- menu/items/scrollingcredits.rb: finally seems to work well
  (title isn't being overwritten, speed of scrolling is constant)
  (another commit: fixed error "last person omitted thanks to forgotten 
  spaces")

[1.February 2009]
- menu/items/credits.rb: place for the fourth developer :)
- menu/menus.rb, menu/items/scrollingcredits.rb: not yet finished variant
  of Credits widget with unlimited space for developers (scrolls)

[24.January 2008]

  for the third developer :) )

[23.January 2009]
- menu/menu.rb: added attribute height, fixed width error

[10.January 2009]
- menu/items/select.rb: change proc doesn't get indices but values;
  added methods 'choice' and 'choice=';
  method 'select' renamed to 'entered_item' (I frogot that method select
  is defined in Menu and is important - it's replacement was breaking mouse
  functionality);
  QuitButton added;
  special sign is shown next to selected item

[8.January 2009]
- menu/menu.rb: selector can be more than one line high if needed (accommodates
  to menu items)

- menu/menus.rb: testing part updated

[31.December 2008]
- menu/menu.rb, menu/menus.rb: changed system of attribute inheritance
  to a more useful and logical one

[17.November 2008]
- Menu.new optionally yields the new object (similar e.g. to File.open)
