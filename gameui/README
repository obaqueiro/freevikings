"Simple menu library for games using RUDL."


== DESCRIPTION ==

When you start writing a game, you don't bother with anything but the
core. (Otherwise your project usually dies befory it starts.)
After some time the core is working well and you start to make the game
user-friendly. 
Most of the games need some possibility to alter some configuration.
Some kind of menu is usually used for this purpose.

My first bigger game project, freeVikings (http://freevikings.wz.cz), 
has come to the point when it is pretty enjoyable and I started to make
the game more user-friendly. So I needed to make menu to access some
features which should be alterable during the game. And I didn't find
any library prepared for this purpose. GameUI is what I have written 
on my own. It isn't perfect, but it works.

At this time GameUI is in a very early stage of development and is strongly 
binded with freeVikings. There is no actual versioning, snapshots are only 
released with every new freeVikings version. And there is no guarantee 
of future development or compatibility with older versions. So it isn't the
best choice to use GameUI in your project now. Wait a year or so,
I'm going to make this library more general and use it in more my projects.
