= Schwerengine

== About

Schwerengine is a game engine making framework for simple arcade games using 
Ruby (programming language) and RUDL (SDL port for Ruby).

'Schwer' means 'hard' in Deutch and it says something about the engine...
It also says something about the engine's only developer's place 
of residence.  It's Svermov (or, as I sometimes like to write it, Schwermoff) -
suburb of Kladno (Europe > Central Europe > Czech republic > Bohemia; 
near to Prague).

== Namespace

All the classes and mixin modules provided by the framework are packed
into a namespace module SchwerEngine to prevent any name clashes.

decided to make some more games.

It is a very uncomfortable feeling when you find yourself trying to re-invent
a wheel. When I found myself writing a class I had already written 
for freeVikings I stopped working and thought about it for a while. You know
what happened in my mind. I decided to create a bundle of classes useful
for writing games. Here it is...
