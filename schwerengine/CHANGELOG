[28. August 2008]
- Location.<< now returns the Location itself (so you can write 
  C++-streams-like chained expressions)
- new methods for (Rectangle.new_empty; empty? bottom=,right=, area, common)
- Location now "gives" itself to ActiveObjects during their registering in 
  the same way as to Sprites
