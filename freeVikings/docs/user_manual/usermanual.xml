      Game is written completely in Ruby. While Ruby is an interpreted 
      programming language, it isn't needed (and most probably even not 
      possible) to compile the code. You just have to install Ruby
      interpreter and a few libraries. Both the interpreter and all needed
      libraries are licensed by open source licenses and you can download
      them all for free.
