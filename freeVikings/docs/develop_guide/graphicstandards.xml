  <chapter>
    <title>Standards for graphic files</title>

    <section>
      <title>Formats</title>
      <para>
	Two formats are currently in use: PNG and TGA. I started with
	PNG (some of the oldest graphics are in this format) and later
	got used to TGA (because a friend told me it has a
	better compression - I don't bother if it's true...).
	You are free to use any of these.
	From serious reasons you can use even other formats,
	the only condition is that RUDL library can load them
	(see <ulink url="http://rudl.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?Surface_Initializers">RUDL Documentation</ulink>).
      </para>
      <para>
	For tilesets (<xref linkend="chapter_tilesets"/>) there is just one standard format, PNG, because the supported
	map editor, <application>Tiled</application>, accepts only PNGs.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Transparency</title>
      <para>
	Both currently used formats, PNG and TGA, support transparency, so
	I use it. (I say this here because I know that some games
	have some standard "transparent colour", often the one
	called "fuchsia" in HTML.)

      Items are small objects which can be collected and later used

      Their graphics are stored in gfx/. They have a standard size
      30 x 30 px. If you have a serious reason to make a bigger item,
      it is needed to make also a smaller version of size 30 x 30 px
      to be shown in the viking's inventory.

    <title>Some general concepts</title>
    <subtitle>Animations, themes, models</subtitle>

    <para>
      This chapter should explain some general concepts used in
      map or monster creation.
    </para>
    
    <section id="sect_theme">
      <title>Theme</title>
      <para>
	While most of the monsters and game objects look the same in every
	level (e.g. all items - it would be really confusing if the healing
	apple was in different levels different), some change their graphical
	coat according to the tileset used in the map or to the legend.
	(E.g. lifts or killing pikes)
      </para>
      <para>
	If you are designing a new tileset, it is likely that you will also 
	want to make a theme for it or at least add some items to any of the 
	existing ones.
      </para>

      <section>
	<title>Theme directory and file structure</title>
	<para>
	  In every theme directory must be a theme definition file
	  with name theme.xml .
	  Below you can see an example, contents of file
	  gfx/themes/IceTheme/theme.xml .
	</para>
	<programlisting>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
&lt;gfx_theme&gt;
  &lt;info&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Ice Theme&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;directory&gt;themes/IceTheme&lt;/directory&gt;

  &lt;data&gt;
    &lt;image name="apex" image="ice_apex.tga" /&gt;

    &lt;image name="bridge" image="ice_bridge.tga" /&gt;

    &lt;image name="switch_on" image="ice_switch_on.tga" /&gt;
    &lt;image name="switch_off" image="ice_switch_off.tga" /&gt;
  &lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/gfx_theme&gt;
	</programlisting>
	<para>
	  Elements inside the 'info' block should be self-explaining.
	  Both are compulsory.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Section 'data' contains one or more elements 'image'.
	  every of them assigns an image file to a string.
	  Path to an image is relative to theme directory,
	  so 'ice_bridge.tga' means 'gfx/themes/IceTheme/ice_bridge.tga'.
	</para>
	<para>
	  You may ask: and what are the strings? (Content of attribute 'name'.)
	  Every game object, which changes it's look according to a theme,
	  asks the theme for it's own images giving some unique
	  strings. E.g. Switch has two such strings: "switch_on" and
	  "switch_off". To get the strings, see source code,
	  another theme, or ask a question to development mailing list.
	</para>
      </section>

      <section>
	<title>Theme inheriting</title>
	<para>
	  At least in the default campaign (levels from locs/DefaultCampaign)
	  I sometimes work with level inheritage.
	  Most of the themed objects have their entries in theme DefaultTheme
	  and that is a theme of DefaultCampaign.
	  Some nested levelsets than either haven't got their own theme and
	  use the whole of inherited one, or define their own entries
	  just for some objects and inherit the others.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Theme inheritage isn't a property of theme, but of levelset.
	</para>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Model</title>
      <para>
	Vikings and some more complicated monsters have their own Model.
	Model is a set of state-image pairs defined in a XML file.
	Model files are stored in gfx/models/.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;

&lt;model&gt;
  &lt;load_pre&gt;

    &lt;state name="falling_standing_left" sym="left"/&gt;
  &lt;/states&gt;
&lt;/model&gt;
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	Section 'load_pre' gives names to images which are used more than once.
	It spares both your fingers and computer's RAM when playing,
	because it makes every image loaded just once.
      </para>
      <para>
	In section 'states' images (by file name - attribute 'image' - or 
	symbolic name given in 'load_pre' - attribute 'sym') are
	assigned to state strings.
	State strings are defined in the source code of viking/monster.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Animation</title>
      <section>
	<title>Animation and files</title>
	<para>
	  When designing monster or viking, you will probably make an animation
	  instead of single image (walking cycles etc.).
	  Convention is to save the animation as a series of files with
	  the same name and a number at the end, e.g.
	  olaf_ko1.tga and olaf_ko2.tga are two parts of an animation.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Don't make animated GIFs and similar stuff - the game can't load it
	  properly.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Animation and Model</title>
	<para>
	  It is possible to define animation in a model XML file
	  (for many examples see gfx/models/olaf_model.xml).
	  Animation has to be defined in 'load_pre'.
	</para>
	<programlisting>
&lt;model&gt;
  &lt;load_pre&gt;
    &lt;image sym="left1"&gt;vikings/olaf/olaf_walk2_left.tga&lt;/image&gt;

    &lt;image sym="left_breath"&gt;vikings/olaf/olaf_breath_left.tga&lt;/image&gt;

    &lt;!-- Walking left --&gt;
    &lt;animation sym="move_left"&gt;
      &lt;image sym="left1"/&gt;
      &lt;image&gt;vikings/olaf/olaf_walk1_left.tga&lt;/image&gt;
    &lt;/animation&gt;

    &lt;!-- Standing looking left --&gt;
    &lt;animation sym="stand_left"&gt;
      &lt;image sym="left1"/&gt;
      &lt;image sym="left_breath"/&gt;      
    &lt;/animation&gt;
  &lt;/load_pre&gt;

  &lt;/states&gt;
&lt;/model&gt;
	</programlisting>
	<para>
	  As you can see, it is possible to use the symbolic
	  names even in 'load_pre'.

  <para>
    Designing vikings means a lot of work and so if you want to
    do it, you should know some basic facts before you start - it wouldn't
    be pleasant to make all the graphics and then find out that they are
    different from the standard and can't be used.
  </para>
  <para>
    Standard size is 80 x 100 px. The viking should fill his image as much 
    as possible (it is strange when he flies 2cm over the ground or is killed
    by a shot which seemed to fly high over his head).
  </para>

    I've scratched a series of pictures mainly for those who haven't ever 
    played lost vikings to show different states of the vikings. There are

      </listitem>
