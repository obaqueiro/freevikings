[   release XXXXXXXX, DDDDDDDDDD  ]

Welcome to freeVikings, an open source clone of great DOS game Lost Vikings.


I. INSTALLATION

* Get ruby [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/]

* Get following libraries:
   ** RUDL [http://sourceforge.net/projects/rudl/]
   ** REXML [included in newer ruby distributions || 
             http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/]
   ** Log4r [optional, you don't need it unless you want to debug freeVikings
             http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/log4r/]

Install ruby, install libraries. FreeVikings don't need (and don't provide)
installation - play from wherever you unpack the archive.

* NOTE: A part of library 'script' by Joel VanderWerf is included 
        in freeVikings distribution. (file 'lib/script.rb') It is distributed 
        under Ruby license.
        'script.rb' which is currently distributed with freeVikings is from
        script 0.3 (see http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/script/)

III. I WOULD LIKE TO HELP

Really? It's great! Any help is welcome.
Surely there is much to do I don't know about, but some tips:
- graphics
- level design
- music and sounds
(if you are a programmer, see TODO for inspiration where to start)
