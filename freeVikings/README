I. What the hell is this?

In 1993 american Sillicon & Synapse made a very nice DOS game called
Lost Vikings. FreeVikings project has been trying to make a simillar
game from scratch. For fun without stupid restrictions of commercial
software. At this time all the code is written in Ruby-it means that
it isn't very fast (actually it's rather slow), but the development is
quick and I really enjoy it.
      The package you have just unpacked is a pre-release. It means
you should expect problems. Try to solve them. You will find a lot of
bugs. Please, report them (severus@post.cz).

II. What will I need?

Ruby >= 1.8.0 (www.ruby-lang.org) and some packages for it (raa.ruby-lang.org):
- rudl >= 0.7
- log4r
- script
- rubyunit (you don't actually need it, but without it you cannot run
tests - it's only usefull for development)

IV. How to play?

At first type
$ ruby freevikings.rb
into your term.

Use cursor keys to move the vikings, try to reach the EXIT place with
all of them.
Switch to the fullscreen mode by F3.
Give up the level by pressing F6 (do this when one of the vikings
stucks somewhere etc.)
Quit the game by combo Ctrl-Q.
Switch between the vikings by Ctrl or PgUp.
-
Baleog (the green one) has a sword and arc and he can clobber monsters
by them. Press D to shoot an arrow, Space to use the sword.
-
Eric (the red guy) can jump (press Space), but it doesn't work well.

V. Known bugs

I'll mention only the most bad one. When the vikings are falling, they
sometimes stuck somewhere in the air. Than you have to press the
cursor keys quickly until they reach the ground. If you didn't do
that, they would die.
