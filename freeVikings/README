Welcome to freeVikings, an open source clone of great DOS game Lost Vikings.


I. INSTALLATION

III. I WOULD LIKE TO HELP

Really? It's great! Any help is welcome.
Surely there is much to do I don't know about, but some tips:
- graphics
- level design
- music and sounds
(if you are a programmer, see TODO for inspiration where to start)
