I. About FreeVikings

FreeVikings is a free clone of a very nice,
well-playable and well-enjoyable, logicle DOS
game "Lost Vikings" from the early nineties.
The goal is to make the three viking guys
(the green one is Baleog, the red one Eric 
and the yellow one Olaf) escape from several
terrible places through the EXIT point.

(I've got a nice legend for FreeVikings, 
but you will have to wait for the 0.2 official
release to read it.)

II. About pre-releases

The development of FreeVikings started, as I can
remember, in January. Release 0.1 was there in
March. It was uncomplete, but playable.
I decided to make 0.2 release soon, but things didn't
go on as I wanted them to.
So I started with releasing pre-versions.
They're intended to show that the development
continues, that the young Czech programmer greenhorn
didn't die. That the three vikings are still OK
and free.
These pre-releases are unstable development versions
for brave testers and code-readers (code-reader is
a programmer-like creature which reads interesting 
source code files instead of fairy-tales before
he falls asleep). The game experience isn't very
shiny...

III. Dependencies

To run FreeVikings, you should have installed
on your system:

* Ruby >= 1.8.0

and it's extensions:

* RUDL >= 0.7 (this depends on the SDL libs)
* Log4r
* Test::Unit (also written as test/unit)
* RubyUnit (may be left out in future versions)
* script
* REXML

You can obtain Ruby at
>>> http://www.ruby-lang.org
and all the extensions (and also some interesting
programs, including FreeVikings) at
>>> http://raa.ruby-lang.org

IV. Installation and Getting started

Don't install. Unpack the tarball
% tar -xvzf freevikings-0.2-pre2
% cd freeVikings-0.2-pre2
and run the freevikings.rb script:
% ruby freevikings.rb

V. Platform

I've tested FreeVikings on GNU/Linux (distros
Mandrake 9.0 and Fedora Core 3) and MS Windows XP.
But you should be able to run this game whereever 
you can install the Ruby language's interpreter, 
because I don't use any platform-dependent 
features.

VI. Game controls

Use arrow keys to move the vikings left and right,
Ctrl and PageUp to switch between them,
Baleog (the green one) can release an arrow
when you press D.
Everyone who has ever played Lost Vikings knows
that the vikings should be able to do more, but 
I havent't implemented any other features yet.
(In the previous release Baleog could use his sword.
I removed this, because the mechanism was terrible
and had slowed the game down rapidly.)

VII. License

GNU/GPL. See GPL file in this directory.

VII. Ideas, Bug reports, Contributions, ...

You're intended to send me any bug reports,
ideas to improve the game, etc.
You can also change the source code and send me 
a patch (or make and distribute your own modified
version of FreeVikings in terms of GNU/GPL).
The last way to help is to make some better
graphics (you can see I am not a very good gimper).
