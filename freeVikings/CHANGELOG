  drag&drop item exchange
- initfv.rb: possibility to switch sound on/off from menu

[29.October 2008]
- transporter.rb, monsters/lift.rb: Fixed "lift down problem":
  Transporter#update_transported_sprites divided into two methods,
  because Transporters, which move transported sprites also in y-axis,
  have to move themselves between updating list of transported sprites
  and moving them in order to ensure that area to which transported sprites 
  are moved is already free at the time of the operation
- added testing level using Tiled map with tiles 32x32 px (works well without
  any additional modifications to SchwerEngine)

[28.October 2008]
- level Stairs to Hell: y coordinate of all objects fixed
- game.rb: fixed error at end of world (throw inside Thread caused 
           ThreadError);

- testing level using multiple tilesets-
  

[19.October 2008]
- levels SwitchPlace & Antarctic Visitors & Peaceful Meadow fixed

  switch characters, left shift uses viking's 'second ability'
- viking.rb: core of S/F key functions moved from GameState to Viking;
- viking.rb, transporter.rb: viking's rect expanded when looking for active
  objects to activate; Transporter's rect expanded when looking for sprites 
  to transport
- monsters/lift.rb: includes Transporter

[18.October 2008]
- viking.rb: docs RD -> RDoc
- gamestate.rb: Possibility to select viking/item also in other states than
  PlayingGameState
- Location#display_rect
- handling of clicks moved from GameState to Game
- new develmagic feature - in-game checking if a rect is free: click in the
  game screen and drom to define checked rect - or double-click a Sprite
  to check it's rect (includes new "monster" TestRect)
- Viking#descend_onto_ground modified because "map dirty thing problem" 
  has been solved (after cca four years of being ignored)
- freevikings.rb: develmagic accessible only in development version

[16.October 2008]

  of StructuredWorld.new;
  StructuredWorld#next_level isn't first called from StructuredWorld#initialize
- story.rb: added message "press Esc to skip" to storyframes
- FreeVikings.valid_location_password -> Level.valid_level_password?

[13.October 2008]
- tests: removed TestTiledMapLoadStrategy and associated data, 'lib/' added
  to $:, errors in TestTalk fixed;
  test source files aren't listed in tests/test.rb, but found at the time 
  of execution (in the same way as in Test::Unit::AutoRunner)
- game.rb: progressbar shown while loading (uses Threads)

[6.October 2008]

- location.rb, maploaderfactory.rb, locationloader.rb: Map2 used instead of 
  Map

[2.October 2008]
- utils/make_release.rb: It wasn't possible to access CVS via SSH
  yesterday while I was preparing archive for release; today I removed
  one temporary modification made yesterday because of this problem
- locs/Tests.../Tiled../MultiLayer2 - testing location for new Map
  features planned for SchwerEngine::Map2

[[[release 0.6] [10/01/2008] ----------------------------------------

[1.October 2008]
- utils/make_release.rb: modifications because of moving package depository
  to SourceForge

[30.September 2008]
- freevikings.rb: fixed error in safe Log4r loading (I misanderstood
  return values of Kernel::require - it returns false if the library
  has already been loaded and raises LoadError if it cannot be loaded)
- User's manual: chapter Troubleshooting
- Development guide: some 'link's changed to 'xref's
- utils/make_release.rb: gameui and schwerengine won't be distributed as
  separate packages, but inside freeVikings archive; 
  work on interactive mode started

[29.September 2008]
- Added directory lib/ (for 'redistributed' libraries -
  currently gameui, schwerengine and script)
- freevikings.rb: safe RUDL loading (checks for RubyGems and bypasses them
  if needed)
- User's manual: Installation, Running and Controls finished
- README: changed dependencies section (removed script, added note
  about it being redistributed)

[27.September 2008]
- GameUI::Textrenderer#create_text_box - new optional argument (background
  colour);
  private method make_lines considers line-breaks correctly again
- gamestate.rb: password displayed at the beginning of level has black 
  background again
- I have written first few paragraphs of User's manual

[25.September 2008]
- game.rb, location.rb: Game#is_exit? -> Location#exitted?
- DefaultCampaign/ArcticLevelSet/SwitchPlace: class IceBoard made a subclass
  of Entity (in order to provide it with methods paint_rect and collision_rect)
- exit.rb: docs RD->RDoc
- location.rb: added 'event handlers' on_beginning, on_exit;
  modified exit conditions
- RubyCampaign/Intro: on_beginning and on_exit handlers start Stories;
- RubyCampaign/Intro, story.rb: TalkFrame class moved to story.rb (it seems 
  useful)
- game.rb: fixed error "uncaught exception at the end of world";
  end-of-world-screen removed (removed method Game#end_of_game) - every 
  campaign should make it's own (by setting on_exit handler in the last
  level)
- DefaultCampaign/NucLabs/YellowHall: New end-of-world Story.
(Uff, two items disappeared from TODO, three or four new ones are there...)

[23.September 2008]
- locationloader.rb: I found out that SyntaxError isn't subclass
  of StandardError, but of ScriptError; so I extended the rescue clause...
- monsters/cottage.rb: simple StaticObject, vikings' cottage
- monsters/boat.rb: speed-up
- RubyCampaign/Intro/intro_script: cottages, door, key, lock
- RubyCampaign/levelsuite.rb: Assembler commented out
- game.rb: FPS displaying fixed (no unreal high numbers)

[20.September 2008]
- story.rb: A new way to tell the game story (I have been thinking about
  something similar for a long time, but now I need it...)
- RubyCampaign/Intro: Removed initial talk and mobile phone.
  It is more secure to tell the campaign legend using a Story.
- location.rb, game.rb, gamestate.rb: Support for Story

[18.September 2008]
- transporter.rb, monsters/flyingplatform.rb: A bit more code 
  from FlyingPlatform in Transporter
- monsters/boat.rb: Boat finished. First class working with different
  paint_rect and collision_rect (rect == collision_rect) !
- RubyCampaign/Intro: lift deleted, boat set up, exit moved

[17.September 2008]
- transporter.rb : mixin module (methods extracted from FlyingPlatform)
- monsters/boat.rb: Boat. Not finished. Needs Entity#collision_rect
  and Entity#paint_rect to be implemented first...
- monsters/flyingplatform.rb: modified inheritance

[16.September 2008]
- StructuredWorld#next_location removed
- game.rb: FPS printing modified (fill instead of filled_rectangle)
- rudlmirror.rb: Finally I managed to write those mirroring methods!
  They work with TGA and PNG images, other formats not tried yet...
- RubyCampaign/Intro: phone_talk.rb: fixed bad speaker id.

[15.September 2008]
- talk.rb, talkable.rb: documentation changed to RDoc format;
  sentence textbox disappears after the user pushes SPACE or ENTER -
  not sooner and not later.
- structuredworld.rb: fixed bug "SW#next_level doesn't update @location"
- game.rb: Because problems in finishing of level occured and I wasn't
  able to solve them, I decided to clean Game#game_loop up. It helped.
- gamestate.rb: AllLocationsFinishedGameState removed

[13.September 2008]
- Developer's guide: descriptive section of vikings' states (with images)
- levelsuite.rb, level.rb, structuredworld.rb:
  Possibility to load level without a levelsuite. Theme can be defined
  in location.xml (not only in levelsuite.xml)
  (I needed this to make it easier for new developers working with
  Level-making-tutorial from the developer's guide.)
- location.rb, game.rb, gamestate.rb, 
  locs/TestsCampaign/Monster.../Conversation:
  New talking engine (I think it's simpler and more Lost-Vikings-Like than 
  that used in locs/Tests../Monster../OrangeHead)
- Fixed MobilePhone (it didn't work because it didn't have
  WIDTH and HEIGHT constants set -> collision Rectangle was empty)

[11.September 2008]
- RubyCampaign/Intro: 
    - conversations written
- location.rb and nullocation.rb moved back from SchwerEngine to freeVikings,
  because they aren't general enough and are messy.
  I also converted their documentation.
- team.rb: documentation converted, Team#[] modified,
  recursive calls in methods 'next' and 'previous' replaced by cycles
- Repaired WideBridge (private class of level ArcticTutorial)
- game.rb, gamestate.rb, location.rb: team moved from Game to Location
- deadviking.rb: modification because of changes in NullLocation
- talk.rb: Data validation should work better
- locationloader.rb: StandardError is caught from the script (instead of
  just RuntimeError and SyntaxError)

[10.September 2008]
- GameUI::Menu : menu window being killed raises an exception, which
  leads to termination of the game (so it is possible to leave game menu
  not only by pressing QuitButton, but also by pressing 'X' button 
  of the window)
- Log4r is just optional. (mocklog4r.rb hacks it around)
- One help in level DefaultCampaign/ArcticTutorial updated
- Possibility to switch sound off
- game.rb: fixed music bug (music started only if you switched password 
  displaying off)
- monsters/mobilephone.rb
- RubyCampaign/Intro: temporarily out-of-order: I must finish MobilePhone
  and write the talk-files.

[8.September 2008]
- monsters/piranha.rb: new monster
- modified RubyCampaign/Intro map and script
- image for boat

[6.September 2008]
- possibility to move through gameui menu simply having a key pressed
  (not needed to press a key again and again)
- mouse support in gameui menu
- Caught some more exceptions during loading of a location
  (locationloader.rb and tiledmaploadstrategy.rb)
- Lock documentation ported to RDoc
- RubyCampaign/Intro level totally changed
- new tileset (coast of the sea)
- Bridge and Lift classes modified (inheritance, behavior of Bridge)
- Bridge is now themed object
- method StaticObject#unregister_in created

[4.September 2008]
- world.rb removed (class World was replaced by subclass StructuredWorld;
  useless superclass removed now)
- tested replacement of Log4r by an empty mockclass, but it didn't speed up
  the game
- Added music support (it is possible to choose music for level in it's
  'location.xml')

[3.September 2008]
- levelsuite.rb: new methods LevelSuite#title and LevelSuite#methods.
  Active member isn't shifted out of Array @members, but just signed
  (variable @active_member_i)
- level.rb: documentation RD -> RDoc; new method Level#title;
- initfv.rb: in the development version it is possible to choose a level
  from a list (you don't need to remember the password)

[2.September 2008]
- Written whole new part of the development guide; guide splitted into
  several files. Successfull XSL transformation using
  xsltproc and XSL templates from http://docbook.sourceforge.net

[1.September 2008]
- Finished auto-releasing tool (utils/make_release.rb), which automates
  nearly everything connected with making a new release
  (creating and uploading packages, updating freshmeat and RAA)
- structuredworld.rb: documentation converted RD -> RDoc
- levelsuite.rb: documentation converted RD -> RDoc

[[[release 0.6-pre3] -----------------------------------------------------
  (Well, it isn't much different from 0.6pre2, but I wanted to test
  the auto-releasing tool)

[30.August 2008]
- README in the main development branch (it's a bit boring to make a new one
  for every release...)
- Nearly finished auto-releasing tool.

[28. August 2008]
- TiledMapLoadStrategy modified so that it can load both map0.99a (Tiled 0.6) 
  and map0.1 (Tiled 0.7) maps. Documentation converted from RD to RDoc
- Teleport created (class + tests + testing level)
- level RubyCampaign/Assembler improved a bit (teleports in dark blue rooms,
  door from room 1 to room 5 (light blue))

[23.August 2008]
- game.rb: RD documentation converted to RDoc
- SchwerEngine and Log4r are loaded AFTER processing commandline options -> 
  I will never more wait 10 seconds before I see help...
- help is generated from the Array of options - it isn't needed to modify HELP 
  whenever a new option is added; HELP contains just a part of what is shown 
  when you type 'freevikings.rb -h'
- I made something which one day may become level of a new campaign

[[[release 0.6-pre2] -----------------------------------------------------

[21.August 2008]
- Distinguish licensing clearly
- Select and move items between inventories using the mouse.
- Inventories which can be accessed (because their owners are next to the 
  active viking) should be somehow emphasized.

[16.August 2008]
Add something like "Authors" or "Credits" to main menu

[7.August 2008]
Possibility to turn off showing the password at the beginning of the level 
(which is a bit annoying e.g. during the development)

[16.July 2008]
- Possibility to skip menu
- 'Close' button ('X') causes total end of the game (as usually wanted 
  by the user) and not only return to the main menu

Theme definition (theme.xml) in gfx/themes/XXXTheme, not 
in locs/DefaultCampaign/XXXLevelSet => more LevelSets can share the same 
graphic theme

Default theme (there is a theme called DefaultTheme; it's a theme 
of DefaultCampaign, so all the nested levels inherit names from it)

Convert all the Monster test locations to the new location standard 
(with no PASSWORD file and with location.xml)
