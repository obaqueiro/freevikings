[9.February 2009]
- sprinter.rb: full implementation of magical helmet
  (can bash Walls and Monsters; clever state changes - falling etc;
  Eric knocked out when he hits wall, Wall or Monster)
- viking.rb: added method knockout
- entities/wall.rb: destroyed Wall deletes itself from the Location properly

[8.February 2009]
- vikingstate.rb, sophisticatedspritestate.rb, viking.rb, shielder.rb,
  sword.rb, warior.rb:
  direction moved back to VikingState, but not to HorizontalState
- horizontalstate.rb: removed remains of direction from here
- ability.rb, sprinter.rb, gfx/models/erik_model.xml, shielder.rb:
  SprinterAbility removed (functionality moved to class Sprinter);
  ShielderAbility removed ( -"-                         Shielder);
  WariorAbility           (                             Warior)
- horizontalstate.rb, stateproprieties.rb: (Not)MovingStateProprieties
  renamed to (Not)MovingState

- model files and images of vikings: all mirrored images facing right removed
  (generated programmatically)
- sprinter.rb, Erik's model file: added missing feature, Erik's magical
  helmet which can destroy Walls (actually the implementation isn't complete
  yet, but Erik already can destroy walls)

[7.February 2009]

  connected with VikingState

[5.February 2009]
- tests/test.rb: removed requirement of tests of compiled extensions;
  added requirement of some files returned from SchwerEngine
- tests/testvikingstate.rb: empty TestSuite removed
- freevikings.rb: I found that option -d works with milliseconds,
  but configfile's entry 'frame delay' with seconds - and changed cmdline
  option to accept seconds too.
- framelimitter.rb: unit for automatic frame limitting (and fps computation)
- fvdef.rb: constant defining maximum fps before game behaves strange
- game.rb: added FrameLimitter
- config/structure.conf, config/defaults.conf, config/config.rb,
  game.rb: extended frame delay setup in configuration file
- viking.rb: removed useless 'protected' (only instance methods can be 
  protected)
  removed inclusion of SophisticatedSpriteMixins::Walking
  (I want to change internals of class Viking, but don't want to affect
  e.g. Bear)
- vikingstate2.rb, tests/testvikingstate.rb: preparing replacement 
  for VikingState (VikingState needs to be replaced by something cleaner
  in order to add some missing states)

[3.February 2009]

  I updated the User's manual (deleted sections about disabling Rubygems
  and libraries which are distributed as part of Ruby's standard library);

- initfv.rb: removed debugging output written yesterday to debug

- README.txt: added reference to User's manual; modified (more look than 
  content)

[1.February 2009]

  writing freeVikings and reading book about Design Patterns, but not 
  everywhere I was able to use them properly...), added nogath's animated
  tombstone graphic
- gfx/tombstone.png: spritesheet of animated tombstone
- config/config.rb, config/defaults.conf, freevikings.rb: 
  fixed documentation about entry 'frame delay' (option -d)

  screen)

[31.January 2009]
- gfx/stone_firespitter.png: replaced by nogath's
- initfv.rb: Federico Borrone AKA nogath added to Credits
- gfx/brick_destroyed.tga: empty image removed
- bomb.rb: moved to entities/ (I must have forgotten to do so earlier)
- README -> README.txt, LICENSE -> LICENSE.txt,
  (because of users of Windows: README should be readable even for total
  Windows newbie and thus it should have a proper extension;
  LICENSE makes name-clash with directory licenses/ on Windows filesystems.)
- util/make_release.rb: changed README filename
- CREDITS, initfv.rb: credits aren't hard-coded in the code of menu,
  but loaded from file CREDITS

[30.January 2009]
- gfx/fireball.png: gfx/brick* : replaced by nogath's
- wall.rb: image filenames updated

- levels of DefaultCampaign: updated position of exit

[25.January 2009]
- exit.rb, location.rb: Exit is not a static object
- gfx/exit.png: replacement for old Exit by Magnus Nygaard
- level Arctic Tutorial: updated position of exit

- docs/user_manual/usermanual.xml: added chapter about configuration file
- location.rb: exit is visible again (disappeared thanks to yesterday's
  painting cleanup)
- fixes of levels before release:
  - level SwitchPlace: fixed (used to add static objects directly through
    Location#static_objects#add => static objects were invisible...)
  - entities/flyingtroll.rb: removed requirement of monster.rb
  - entities/lock.rb: Added error which deleted lock on unlocking attempt
    even if key wasn't right
  - entities/ladder.rb: Ladder is semi-solid again

[23.January 2009]
- heroandmonster.rb entity.rb sprite.rb item.rb staticobject.rb activeobject.rb
  some classes moved back from SchwerEngine, because they aren't general enough
- many files: removed requirement of monster.rb (I learned some basics of 'sed'
  because of it :) )
- location.rb, zsortedgroup.rb: more efficient strategy of z-sorted painting -
  without sorting all game objects in every frame.
  Unfortunatelly it didn't bring a single fps :(

- game.rb, gamestate.rb: ingame menu (restart/exit/back)

[22.January 2009]

- viking.rb: repeated calls of methods 'next_[left|top]' replaced with
  instance variables with values assigned once per update
- game.rb, freevikings.rb: profiler from Ruby's standard library replaced with
  ruby-prof (ruby-prof is compiled and thus game runs at 2 fps during
  profiling, while with stdlib profiler it was cca 0.1 fps :) )

[21.January 2009]

  replaced with new graphic made by Magnus Nygaard

- locs/Tests.../Ancient.../First/first_script.rb: fixed (was broken)

  fixed; some code (finding title of Level(Suite) in a directory) from 
  initfv.rb moved to class LevelSuite and reused in freevikings.rb

[9.January 2009] 
- FREEVIKINGS BROKEN UP! CHECK OUT OLDER VERSION TO PLAY!
- initfv.rb: Select to choose campaign
- structuredworld.rb, levelsuite.rb: requirement stuff cleared a bit
- config/... : added new config entry (dirs with campaigns)

[8.January 2009]
- passwordedit.rb: RD->RDoc

  been there, but didn't do anything), removed class DisplayModeChooseButton
  (not needed - FVConfiguratorButton with right Proc can do the same work)
- initfv.rb: DisplayModeChooseButton replaced with FVConfiguratorButton

[5.January 2009]
- removed content of directory ext/ (old compiled replacement for critical 
  classes)
- config/log4rconfig.rb: created special log for loading of configuration
  and one common log for all cases where I'm too lazy to create new one.
- freevikings.rb: configuration file is first searched in
  $FREEVIKINGS_HOME, than in $HOME/.freeVikings
- location.rb: configurable order of vikings
- fvdef.rb: added missing slash which caused error in all levels with objects
  using GfxTheme.

[2.January 2009]

[1.January 2009]
- collisiontest.rb: RD->RDoc (why don't I move this to SchwerEngine?)
- alternatives.rb: removed (remaining corpse of the compiled extensions 
  will be removed soon)
- all files which deal with configuration: configuration files fully enabled
- configuration.rb: on errors name of configuration file is reported;
  Proc with condition can be used in the structure-defining script;
  script loading is SyntaxError-safe
- game.rb: music volume configurability

[31.December 2008]
- fvdef.rb, initfv.rb: panel placement may be set in menu;
  submenu "Graphics" is 50px wider than the rest (because of it)
- topmenu.rb: RD->RDoc
- bottompanelstate.rb: in ItemsExchangeBottomPanelState keys up and down
  are synonyms for left and right (to make it more natural when
  BottomPanel is placed vertically)
- game.rb: fixed mouse controls for BottomPanel in right position
- game.rb, gamestate.rb, bottompanel.rb, bpvikingview.rb: 
  F5 switches panel position in-game

  symbol of recyclation rotates for a while
- created directory config/, configuration files moved there
- configuration.rb: class for loading configuration files
- config/structure.conf: definition of structure of a configuration file
  and supported values

[30.December 2008]
- viking.rb: Viking standing on the top of a ladder is able to climb it down.
- game.rb, bottompanel.rb, bpvikingview.rb, location.rb:
  variable placement of BottomPanel: not only at the bottom of window, but also
  at the top, on the left or on the right

[29.December 2008]
- bottompanel.rb, bpvikingview.rb: 
  cleaner way of determining where user clicked (done by VikingView, 
  not by BottomPanel);
  double-click on an item uses it
- transporter.rb, transportable.rb: commented-out debugging output
- location.rb: all objects get reference of Location
- entities/lock.rb: unlocked Lock deletes itself from the Location
- shielder.rb: Shield is informed about Olaf's transport, so it doesn't move
  with a delay

[[[release 0.7] [12/27/2008] ----------------------------------------

[27.December 2008]
- entities/present.rb: fixed error in 'present deletion hack'

- game.rb: commented-out two annoying logging outputs
- level HappyLEnd finished
- entities/switch.rb: Switch#switch: workaround for Procs with various arity
- entities/lift.rb: includes StaticObject
- viking.rb: added requirement of 'ladder.rb';
  Viking#transport_move: y isn't changed according to argument, but
  transporter's rect (it's a bit dirty, but works well);
  BASE_VELOCITY increased to 100px/s
- transporter.rb, transportable.rb: RD->RDoc; unregistering is now done by
  Transportable, not Transporter
  (I was - and I hope that successfully - trying to fix Lift...)
- DefaultCampaign: all old levels made playable (i.a. by fixing Lift and
  some more objects), unfinished level StairsToHell excluded;
  however, they still need some refinements - e.g. to set z for some
  older objects
- textbox.rb: RD->RDoc
- entities/helpbutton.rb: help text is placed a bit higher to be more readable
- utils/make_release.rb: omits empty directories in cvs checkout

- sword.rb: fixed to work with z-ordered drawing (two lines in 'initialize')
- troll.rb: fixed walking right; troll is stopped by shield;
- entities/troll.rb: Troll (hopefully) finished
- gfx/troll.png: added attack frame; spritesheet is very raw, but I won't
  try to finish it these Christmas - there are more important things to do
- theme UndergroundCave: new image for apex (not very good...)
- level HolyHole: added trolls and apexes; level finished
- entities/present.rb: present box (for level HappyLEnd)
- entities/flyingtroll + testing level: new monster from the family of trolls;
  has angel-like wings, shoots arrows, is 'programmable' (like Troll)
- viking.rb: fixed error in fall+ladder+fall hurt detection
- level Climbin' finished (paths of flying trolls might need some small
  modification yet)
- remade snow tiles (snowcover.png) - I studied one screenshot from LV1 and
  tried to create a similar structure
- new tileset: snow on branches of a tree (the same technique)
- level HappyLEnd: added presents, new branches and snow on the tree,
  first attempt to write Thor's code

[25.December 2008]

- entities/troll.rb: added some agressive behavior

[23.December 2008]
- tests: some tests broken by recent changes fixed
- entities/troll.rb, gfx/troll.png, monster test level TRLL: 
  new monster for caves 
  (instead of LivingStone, which needs some more improvements
  of Animation before it can be animated properly);
- programwalker.rb: lisp-like scripting for Troll and other monsters
  (I needed simple 'scripting language' with thin parser that serves commands
  on demand)
- viking.rb, bpvikingview.rb: Viking more friendly to tests

[22.December 2008]
- location.rb: SpriteManager#update removed, functionality moved to Location
- entities/smallstone.rb: small game object, will be used together with
  LivingStone
- new level Christmas2008/HappyLEnd

  fixed error "viking starts climbing up when meeting ladder with 'down'
  button pressed"

  portraits"

[19.December 2008]
- bottompanel.rb, bpvikingview.rb, viking.rb, inventory.rb:
  Fixed problem "VikingView doesn't update on life loss":
  VikingView is observer of both Viking and Inventory
- viking.rb: keep UP key pressed, viking will wait till he collides 
  with a ladder and start climbing it (current system "press UP to try 
  to climb" was uncomfortable for the player - at least for me :) )
- shielder.rb: shield disappears when Olaf is climbing or KO;
  fixed error "Olaf climbs slowly with shield over his head"
- shield.rb: Shield's position is determined according to Olaf's
  paint_rect, not collision_rect (looks better)
- location.rb: fixed error: objects were painted according to their rect,
  not collision_rect
- entities/boat.rb: boat is painted in front of the vikings (looks better)
- game.rb, fvdef.rb, initfv.rb: in a level level name and password are
  shown in window caption

  fixed requirement statements of moved entities

[15.December 2008]
- gfx/runes_[large, small].png: runes for rune stones and rune gems
- entities from top directory moved to 'entities' (with exception of vikings,
  sword and shield);
  also entities from directory 'monsters' moved there
- gfx/runestone.png: awful, but I can't make it better for now
- game.rb, some entities: fixed require statements (requiring from 'monsters')
- fvdef.rb, freevikings.rb: 'entities/' added to $:, 'monsters/' removed
- entities/runestone.rb: three classes of different runic stones
- entities/door.rb: @rect.w changes according to state of the object
- gfx/themes/UndergroundCave (new theme, now has just a bridge)
- entities/bridge.rb: added comment about initialisation
- entities/fallingstone.rb: New funny game object which likes to kill vikings
- level HolyHole: nearly ready (needs just apexes and some monsters)
- ... (most probably I forgot a lot of things...)

[13.December 2008]
- started work on gfx/runestone.png

[12.December 2008]
- viking.rb, monstermixins.rb:
  'a.XX_on_rect(r).each {}' replaced by 'a.XX_on_rect(r) {}' (less iterations -
  new feature of SchwerEngine::Group)
- utils/tiletester.rb: repaired
- viking.rb, vikingstate.rb, LDDR level: solved two ladder issues: 
  viking doesn't "pop" on the top of ladder if the area over ladder isn't free;
  he also falls when he reaches bottom of a ladder
- new tilesets and new campaign 'Christmas 2008'

[11.December 2008]
- trying to solve problem with exitting from Ladder testing level I looked 
  at code of class Exit, added width and height (so that exit area is not
  just the top-left corner, but whole area of the image) and rewrote method 
  Exit#team_exited?, which was awfully uneffective
- added climbing states to models of Olaf and Baleog (although I haven't
  painted special images for them because graphics of vikings should
  be replaced as soon as possible)  
- viking.rb: viking stops moving horizontally before he starts climbing
  (bug fix)
- sophisticatedspritestate.rb: modified method SophisticatedSpriteState#rising?
  so that it returns false when viking is climbing; then he doesn't fall when
  he hits ceiling while climbing, just stops
- gamestate.rb: if development magic is on, F9 kills active viking (sadistic,
  but sometimes useful...)
- game.rb: fix bug which caused crash after the last viking was killed with F9

[7.December 2008]
- sprinter.rb, sophisticatedspritestate.rb: Erik is able again to jump
  when he is walking
- location.rb, viking.rb, shield.rb, sprinter.rb, warior.rb, shielder.rb: 
  added support for z (layer index) (-> shield never more disappears behind 
  other static objects, but fps is probably decreased a bit)
- switch.rb, teleport.rb, helpbutton.rb: methods 'activate' and 'deactivate'
  receive argument
- helpbutton.rb: RD->RDoc
- ladder.rb: code finished (Ladder is ActiveObject now)
- viking.rb, verticalstate.rb, horizontalstate.rb, gamestate.rb:
  Vikings can climb up and down on a ladder.
- Ladder testing level modified (two more ladders, exit achievable only
  by climbing two of them)

[4.December 2008]
- bottompanel.rb, bottompanelstate.rb: "keyboard-driven exchange of items" 
  has more proper visual representation (biggest displaying bug fixed);
  It is impossible to go into ItemsExchange mode if the active viking has 
  nothing to give
- shielder.rb: Shield disappears after Olaf's death

[28.November 2008]
- bottompanel.rb, bpvikingview.rb, game.rb, gamestate.rb, inventory.rb:
  after hours of work BottomPanel is repaired after reconstruction;
  it isn't cleaner, but has new Ingo's trash and highlighting of item
  exchange participants;
  the only known bug now is in displaying of old-school (keyboard driven)
  item transaction
- TODO: added screenshot key description
- added three new versions of Ingo's teleport graphics


[27.November 2008]
- DefaultTheme is theme of TestsCampaign
- TestsTheme doesn't have special look of Switch

- bpvikingview.rb: replacement of InventoryView and part of BottomPanel

[25.November 2008]
- shielder.rb: doesn't add Shield to NullLocation
- gamestate.rb, game.rb: Screenshot taking (I had to implement this to be able
  to take screenshots of bomb explosion because I wasn't able to catch it
  with ImageMagick's 'import')

[24.November 2008]
- sophisticatedspritestate.rb: RD->RDoc
- location.rb: Location#find_surface
- viking.rb: New descending mechanism (using Location#find_surface);
  error "1px under viking fixed not considered error any more;
  fixed by making collision rect 1px lower"
- monsters/cottage.rb: made semi-solid (first semi-solid object in the game)
- shielder.rb, shield.rb: Shield changed from Sprite to semi-solid
  StaticObject; works better now (vikings don't fall through it)
- sprinter.rb Sprinter#space_func_on: fixed error "Erik can't jump from shield"
  and caused two new errors
- RubyCampaign/Intro: start moved 10px up

[23.November 2008]
- viking.rb: Viking#collision_rect is smaller than Viking#paint_rect (it's
  70px wide now)
- game.rb, location.rb: one huge blit operation replaced with clipping;
  unfortunatelly it didn't increase frame rate... :(
- game.rb: Game#paint_loading_screen - progressbar doesn't go behind window 
  frame

[16.November 2008]
- sprinter.rb: fixed a piece of dirt from yesterday
- game.rb: fixed method visibility after yesterday's cleanup
- ladder.rb + testing level + graphic: beginning of a new game object 
  (currently doesn't do anything, just shows)
- monster.rb: documentation modified
- freevikings.rb, fvdef.rb, initfv.rb, game.rb: Loading progressbar made 
  optional (switching with both option and menu)
- game.rb, gamestate.rb: Only keyboard events are given to GameState,
  other events are state independent and as such are served directly
  in Game#every_frame

[15.November 2008]
- gfx/brick_destroyed.tga: destroyed brick is now invisible
- vikingstate.rb, horizontalstate.rb, verticalstate.rb: RD -> RDoc
- game.rb: methods divided into categories m
- gfx/vikings/erik/erik_bullhead_*.tga: awful scratches of erik using his
  "D ability" - "Bullhead"

[12.November 2008]
- game.rb: possibility to cancel loading of a level (press Escape)
- bomb.rb: Flame is animated; destruction is done by Flame, not by
  BombSprite
- wall.rb: animated destruction

[6.November 2008]
- tests/...: fixes of tests broken after modifications in BottomPanel,
  Map loading etc.

(Modifications listed above took 2 hours and were done because of fixing broken
tests.)
- bomb.rb: Bomb has a visible flame
- docs/develop_guide/ : on Monday or so I worked on the Developer's guide

[1.November 2008]
- bomb.rb: bomb only kills Heroes and Monsters, not all sprites;
           fired bombs are forced to explode

  smashable wall

  it just kills vikings and other sprites, in future it will also destroy
  walls)

[30.October 2008]

  drag&drop item exchange
- initfv.rb: possibility to switch sound on/off from menu

[29.October 2008]
- transporter.rb, monsters/lift.rb: Fixed "lift down problem":
  Transporter#update_transported_sprites divided into two methods,
  because Transporters, which move transported sprites also in y-axis,
  have to move themselves between updating list of transported sprites
  and moving them in order to ensure that area to which transported sprites 
  are moved is already free at the time of the operation
- added testing level using Tiled map with tiles 32x32 px (works well without
  any additional modifications to SchwerEngine)

[28.October 2008]
- level Stairs to Hell: y coordinate of all objects fixed
- game.rb: fixed error at end of world (throw inside Thread caused 
           ThreadError);

- gamestate.rb: Possibility to select viking/item also in other states than
  PlayingGameState
- Location#display_rect
- handling of clicks moved from GameState to Game

  game screen and drom to define checked rect - or double-click a Sprite
  to check it's rect (includes new "monster" TestRect)
- Viking#descend_onto_ground modified because "map dirty thing problem" 
  has been solved (after cca four years of being ignored)
- freevikings.rb: develmagic accessible only in development version

[16.October 2008]
- StructuredWorld.rb, game.rb: removed argument 'password' 
  of StructuredWorld.new;
  StructuredWorld#next_level isn't first called from StructuredWorld#initialize
- story.rb: added message "press Esc to skip" to storyframes
- FreeVikings.valid_location_password -> Level.valid_level_password?

[13.October 2008]
- tests: removed TestTiledMapLoadStrategy and associated data, 'lib/' added
  to $:, errors in TestTalk fixed;
  test source files aren't listed in tests/test.rb, but found at the time 
  of execution (in the same way as in Test::Unit::AutoRunner)
- game.rb: progressbar shown while loading (uses Threads)

[6.October 2008]
- maploaderfactory.rb: XmlMap2LoadStrategy added
- locs/ArcticLevelSet/ArcticTutorial: start and exit position fixed
- maploaderfactory.rb, location.rb: changes due to "Map2 -> Map" name change

[3.October 2008]

- tiledmaploadstrategy.rb and xmlmaploadstrategy.rb moved to SchwerEngine
- maploaderfactory.rb: require of moved classes removed; docs RD->RDoc
- location.rb, maploaderfactory.rb, locationloader.rb: Map2 used instead of 
  Map

[2.October 2008]
- utils/make_release.rb: It wasn't possible to access CVS via SSH
  yesterday while I was preparing archive for release; today I removed
  one temporary modification made yesterday because of this problem
- locs/Tests.../Tiled../MultiLayer2 - testing location for new Map
  features planned for SchwerEngine::Map2

[[[release 0.6] [10/01/2008] ----------------------------------------

[1.October 2008]
- utils/make_release.rb: modifications because of moving package depository
  to SourceForge

[30.September 2008]
- freevikings.rb: fixed error in safe Log4r loading (I misanderstood
  return values of Kernel::require - it returns false if the library
  has already been loaded and raises LoadError if it cannot be loaded)
- User's manual: chapter Troubleshooting
- Development guide: some 'link's changed to 'xref's
- utils/make_release.rb: gameui and schwerengine won't be distributed as
  separate packages, but inside freeVikings archive; 
  work on interactive mode started

[29.September 2008]
- Added directory lib/ (for 'redistributed' libraries -
  currently gameui, schwerengine and script)
- freevikings.rb: safe RUDL loading (checks for RubyGems and bypasses them
  if needed)
- User's manual: Installation, Running and Controls finished
- README: changed dependencies section (removed script, added note
  about it being redistributed)

[27.September 2008]
- GameUI::Textrenderer#create_text_box - new optional argument (background
  colour);
  private method make_lines considers line-breaks correctly again
- gamestate.rb: password displayed at the beginning of level has black 
  background again
- I have written first few paragraphs of User's manual

[25.September 2008]
- game.rb, location.rb: Game#is_exit? -> Location#exitted?
- DefaultCampaign/ArcticLevelSet/SwitchPlace: class IceBoard made a subclass
  of Entity (in order to provide it with methods paint_rect and collision_rect)
- exit.rb: docs RD->RDoc
- location.rb: added 'event handlers' on_beginning, on_exit;
  modified exit conditions
- RubyCampaign/Intro: on_beginning and on_exit handlers start Stories;
- RubyCampaign/Intro, story.rb: TalkFrame class moved to story.rb (it seems 
  useful)
- game.rb: fixed error "uncaught exception at the end of world";
  end-of-world-screen removed (removed method Game#end_of_game) - every 
  campaign should make it's own (by setting on_exit handler in the last
  level)
- DefaultCampaign/NucLabs/YellowHall: New end-of-world Story.
(Uff, two items disappeared from TODO, three or four new ones are there...)

[23.September 2008]
- locationloader.rb: I found out that SyntaxError isn't subclass
  of StandardError, but of ScriptError; so I extended the rescue clause...
- monsters/cottage.rb: simple StaticObject, vikings' cottage
- monsters/boat.rb: speed-up
- RubyCampaign/Intro/intro_script: cottages, door, key, lock
- RubyCampaign/levelsuite.rb: Assembler commented out
- game.rb: FPS displaying fixed (no unreal high numbers)

[20.September 2008]
- story.rb: A new way to tell the game story (I have been thinking about
  something similar for a long time, but now I need it...)
- RubyCampaign/Intro: Removed initial talk and mobile phone.
  It is more secure to tell the campaign legend using a Story.
- location.rb, game.rb, gamestate.rb: Support for Story

[18.September 2008]
- transporter.rb, monsters/flyingplatform.rb: A bit more code 
  from FlyingPlatform in Transporter
- monsters/boat.rb: Boat finished. First class working with different
  paint_rect and collision_rect (rect == collision_rect) !
- RubyCampaign/Intro: lift deleted, boat set up, exit moved

[17.September 2008]
- transporter.rb : mixin module (methods extracted from FlyingPlatform)
- monsters/boat.rb: Boat. Not finished. Needs Entity#collision_rect
  and Entity#paint_rect to be implemented first...
- monsters/flyingplatform.rb: modified inheritance

[16.September 2008]
- StructuredWorld#next_location removed
- game.rb: FPS printing modified (fill instead of filled_rectangle)
- rudlmirror.rb: Finally I managed to write those mirroring methods!
  They work with TGA and PNG images, other formats not tried yet...
- RubyCampaign/Intro: phone_talk.rb: fixed bad speaker id.

[15.September 2008]
- talk.rb, talkable.rb: documentation changed to RDoc format;
  sentence textbox disappears after the user pushes SPACE or ENTER -
  not sooner and not later.
- structuredworld.rb: fixed bug "SW#next_level doesn't update @location"
- game.rb: Because problems in finishing of level occured and I wasn't
  able to solve them, I decided to clean Game#game_loop up. It helped.
- gamestate.rb: AllLocationsFinishedGameState removed

[13.September 2008]
- Developer's guide: descriptive section of vikings' states (with images)
- levelsuite.rb, level.rb, structuredworld.rb:
  Possibility to load level without a levelsuite. Theme can be defined
  in location.xml (not only in levelsuite.xml)
  (I needed this to make it easier for new developers working with
  Level-making-tutorial from the developer's guide.)
- location.rb, game.rb, gamestate.rb, 
  locs/TestsCampaign/Monster.../Conversation:
  New talking engine (I think it's simpler and more Lost-Vikings-Like than 
  that used in locs/Tests../Monster../OrangeHead)
- Fixed MobilePhone (it didn't work because it didn't have
  WIDTH and HEIGHT constants set -> collision Rectangle was empty)

[11.September 2008]
- RubyCampaign/Intro: 
    - conversations written
- location.rb and nullocation.rb moved back from SchwerEngine to freeVikings,
  because they aren't general enough and are messy.
  I also converted their documentation.
- team.rb: documentation converted, Team#[] modified,
  recursive calls in methods 'next' and 'previous' replaced by cycles
- Repaired WideBridge (private class of level ArcticTutorial)
- game.rb, gamestate.rb, location.rb: team moved from Game to Location
- deadviking.rb: modification because of changes in NullLocation
- talk.rb: Data validation should work better
- locationloader.rb: StandardError is caught from the script (instead of
  just RuntimeError and SyntaxError)

[10.September 2008]
- GameUI::Menu : menu window being killed raises an exception, which
  leads to termination of the game (so it is possible to leave game menu
  not only by pressing QuitButton, but also by pressing 'X' button 
  of the window)
- Log4r is just optional. (mocklog4r.rb hacks it around)
- One help in level DefaultCampaign/ArcticTutorial updated
- Possibility to switch sound off
- game.rb: fixed music bug (music started only if you switched password 
  displaying off)
- monsters/mobilephone.rb
- RubyCampaign/Intro: temporarily out-of-order: I must finish MobilePhone
  and write the talk-files.

[8.September 2008]
- monsters/piranha.rb: new monster
- modified RubyCampaign/Intro map and script
- image for boat

[6.September 2008]
- possibility to move through gameui menu simply having a key pressed
  (not needed to press a key again and again)
- mouse support in gameui menu
- Caught some more exceptions during loading of a location
  (locationloader.rb and tiledmaploadstrategy.rb)
- Lock documentation ported to RDoc
- RubyCampaign/Intro level totally changed
- new tileset (coast of the sea)
- Bridge and Lift classes modified (inheritance, behavior of Bridge)
- Bridge is now themed object
- method StaticObject#unregister_in created

[4.September 2008]
- world.rb removed (class World was replaced by subclass StructuredWorld;
  useless superclass removed now)
- tested replacement of Log4r by an empty mockclass, but it didn't speed up
  the game
- Added music support (it is possible to choose music for level in it's
  'location.xml')

[3.September 2008]
- levelsuite.rb: new methods LevelSuite#title and LevelSuite#methods.
  Active member isn't shifted out of Array @members, but just signed
  (variable @active_member_i)
- level.rb: documentation RD -> RDoc; new method Level#title;
- initfv.rb: in the development version it is possible to choose a level
  from a list (you don't need to remember the password)

[2.September 2008]
- Written whole new part of the development guide; guide splitted into
  several files. Successfull XSL transformation using
  xsltproc and XSL templates from http://docbook.sourceforge.net

[1.September 2008]
- Finished auto-releasing tool (utils/make_release.rb), which automates
  nearly everything connected with making a new release
  (creating and uploading packages, updating freshmeat and RAA)
- structuredworld.rb: documentation converted RD -> RDoc
- levelsuite.rb: documentation converted RD -> RDoc

[[[release 0.6-pre3] -----------------------------------------------------
  (Well, it isn't much different from 0.6pre2, but I wanted to test
  the auto-releasing tool)

[30.August 2008]
- README in the main development branch (it's a bit boring to make a new one
  for every release...)
- Nearly finished auto-releasing tool.

[28. August 2008]
- TiledMapLoadStrategy modified so that it can load both map0.99a (Tiled 0.6) 
  and map0.1 (Tiled 0.7) maps. Documentation converted from RD to RDoc
- Teleport created (class + tests + testing level)
- level RubyCampaign/Assembler improved a bit (teleports in dark blue rooms,
  door from room 1 to room 5 (light blue))

[23.August 2008]
- game.rb: RD documentation converted to RDoc
- SchwerEngine and Log4r are loaded AFTER processing commandline options -> 
  I will never more wait 10 seconds before I see help...
- help is generated from the Array of options - it isn't needed to modify HELP 
  whenever a new option is added; HELP contains just a part of what is shown 
  when you type 'freevikings.rb -h'
- I made something which one day may become level of a new campaign

[[[release 0.6-pre2] -----------------------------------------------------

[21.August 2008]
- Distinguish licensing clearly
- Select and move items between inventories using the mouse.
- Inventories which can be accessed (because their owners are next to the 
  active viking) should be somehow emphasized.

[16.August 2008]
Add something like "Authors" or "Credits" to main menu

[7.August 2008]
Possibility to turn off showing the password at the beginning of the level 
(which is a bit annoying e.g. during the development)

[16.July 2008]
- Possibility to skip menu
- 'Close' button ('X') causes total end of the game (as usually wanted 
  by the user) and not only return to the main menu

Theme definition (theme.xml) in gfx/themes/XXXTheme, not 
in locs/DefaultCampaign/XXXLevelSet => more LevelSets can share the same 
graphic theme

Default theme (there is a theme called DefaultTheme; it's a theme 
of DefaultCampaign, so all the nested levels inherit names from it)

Convert all the Monster test locations to the new location standard 
(with no PASSWORD file and with location.xml)
