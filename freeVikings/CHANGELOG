[13.September 2008]
- Developer's guide: descriptive section of vikings' states (with images)
- levelsuite.rb, level.rb, structuredworld.rb:
  Possibility to load level without a levelsuite. Theme can be defined
  in location.xml (not only in levelsuite.xml)
  (I needed this to make it easier for new developers working with
  Level-making-tutorial from the developer's guide.)
- location.rb, game.rb, gamestate.rb, 
  locs/TestsCampaign/Monster.../Conversation:
  New talking engine (I think it's simpler and more Lost-Vikings-Like than 
  that used in locs/Tests../Monster../OrangeHead)
- Fixed MobilePhone (it didn't work because it didn't have
  WIDTH and HEIGHT constants set -> collision Rectangle was empty)

[11.September 2008]
- RubyCampaign/Intro: 
    - conversations written
- location.rb and nullocation.rb moved back from SchwerEngine to freeVikings,
  because they aren't general enough and are messy.
  I also converted their documentation.
- team.rb: documentation converted, Team#[] modified,
  recursive calls in methods 'next' and 'previous' replaced by cycles
- Repaired WideBridge (private class of level ArcticTutorial)
- game.rb, gamestate.rb, location.rb: team moved from Game to Location
- deadviking.rb: modification because of changes in NullLocation
- talk.rb: Data validation should work better
- locationloader.rb: StandardError is caught from the script (instead of
  just RuntimeError and SyntaxError)

[10.September 2008]
- GameUI::Menu : menu window being killed raises an exception, which
  leads to termination of the game (so it is possible to leave game menu
  not only by pressing QuitButton, but also by pressing 'X' button 
  of the window)
- Log4r is just optional. (mocklog4r.rb hacks it around)
- One help in level DefaultCampaign/ArcticTutorial updated
- Possibility to switch sound off
- game.rb: fixed music bug (music started only if you switched password 
  displaying off)
- monsters/mobilephone.rb
- RubyCampaign/Intro: temporarily out-of-order: I must finish MobilePhone
  and write the talk-files.

[8.September 2008]
- monsters/piranha.rb: new monster
- modified RubyCampaign/Intro map and script
- image for boat

[6.September 2008]
- possibility to move through gameui menu simply having a key pressed
  (not needed to press a key again and again)
- mouse support in gameui menu
- Caught some more exceptions during loading of a location
  (locationloader.rb and tiledmaploadstrategy.rb)
- Lock documentation ported to RDoc
- RubyCampaign/Intro level totally changed
- new tileset (coast of the sea)
- Bridge and Lift classes modified (inheritance, behavior of Bridge)
- Bridge is now themed object
- method StaticObject#unregister_in created

[4.September 2008]
- world.rb removed (class World was replaced by subclass StructuredWorld;
  useless superclass removed now)
- tested replacement of Log4r by an empty mockclass, but it didn't speed up
  the game
- Added music support (it is possible to choose music for level in it's
  'location.xml')

[3.September 2008]
- levelsuite.rb: new methods LevelSuite#title and LevelSuite#methods.
  Active member isn't shifted out of Array @members, but just signed
  (variable @active_member_i)
- level.rb: documentation RD -> RDoc; new method Level#title;
- initfv.rb: in the development version it is possible to choose a level
  from a list (you don't need to remember the password)

[2.September 2008]
- Written whole new part of the development guide; guide splitted into
  several files. Successfull XSL transformation using
  xsltproc and XSL templates from http://docbook.sourceforge.net

[1.September 2008]
- Finished auto-releasing tool (utils/make_release.rb), which automates
  nearly everything connected with making a new release
  (creating and uploading packages, updating freshmeat and RAA)
- structuredworld.rb: documentation converted RD -> RDoc
- levelsuite.rb: documentation converted RD -> RDoc

[[[release 0.6-pre3] -----------------------------------------------------
  (Well, it isn't much different from 0.6pre2, but I wanted to test
  the auto-releasing tool)

[30.August 2008]
- README in the main development branch (it's a bit boring to make a new one
  for every release...)
- Nearly finished auto-releasing tool.

[28. August 2008]
- TiledMapLoadStrategy modified so that it can load both map0.99a (Tiled 0.6) 
  and map0.1 (Tiled 0.7) maps. Documentation converted from RD to RDoc
- Teleport created (class + tests + testing level)
- level RubyCampaign/Assembler improved a bit (teleports in dark blue rooms,
  door from room 1 to room 5 (light blue))

[23.August 2008]
- game.rb: RD documentation converted to RDoc
- SchwerEngine and Log4r are loaded AFTER processing commandline options -> 
  I will never more wait 10 seconds before I see help...
- help is generated from the Array of options - it isn't needed to modify HELP 
  whenever a new option is added; HELP contains just a part of what is shown 
  when you type 'freevikings.rb -h'
- I made something which one day may become level of a new campaign

[[[release 0.6-pre2] -----------------------------------------------------

[21.August 2008]
- Distinguish licensing clearly
- Select and move items between inventories using the mouse.
- Inventories which can be accessed (because their owners are next to the 
  active viking) should be somehow emphasized.

[16.August 2008]
Add something like "Authors" or "Credits" to main menu

[7.August 2008]
Possibility to turn off showing the password at the beginning of the level 
(which is a bit annoying e.g. during the development)

[16.July 2008]
- Possibility to skip menu
- 'Close' button ('X') causes total end of the game (as usually wanted 
  by the user) and not only return to the main menu

Theme definition (theme.xml) in gfx/themes/XXXTheme, not 
in locs/DefaultCampaign/XXXLevelSet => more LevelSets can share the same 
graphic theme

Default theme (there is a theme called DefaultTheme; it's a theme 
of DefaultCampaign, so all the nested levels inherit names from it)

Convert all the Monster test locations to the new location standard 
(with no PASSWORD file and with location.xml)
