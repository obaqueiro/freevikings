[30.August 2008]
- README in the main development branch (it's a bit boring to make a new one
  for every release...)

[28. August 2008]
- TiledMapLoadStrategy modified so that it can load both map0.99a (Tiled 0.6) 
  and map0.1 (Tiled 0.7) maps. Documentation converted from RD to RDoc
- Teleport created (class + tests + testing level)
- level RubyCampaign/Assembler improved a bit (teleports in dark blue rooms,
  door from room 1 to room 5 (light blue))

[23.August 2008]
- game.rb: RD documentation converted to RDoc
- SchwerEngine and Log4r are loaded AFTER processing commandline options -> 
  I will never more wait 10 seconds before I see help...
- help is generated from the Array of options - it isn't needed to modify HELP 
  whenever a new option is added; HELP contains just a part of what is shown 
  when you type 'freevikings.rb -h'
- I made something which one day may become level of a new campaign

[release 0.6-pre2] -----------------------------------------------------

[21.August 2008]
- Distinguish licensing clearly
- Select and move items between inventories using the mouse.
- Inventories which can be accessed (because their owners are next to the 
  active viking) should be somehow emphasized.

[16.August 2008]
Add something like "Authors" or "Credits" to main menu

[7.August 2008]
Possibility to turn off showing the password at the beginning of the level 
(which is a bit annoying e.g. during the development)

[16.July 2008]
- Possibility to skip menu
- 'Close' button ('X') causes total end of the game (as usually wanted by the user) and not only return to the main menu

Theme definition (theme.xml) in gfx/themes/XXXTheme, not in locs/DefaultCampaign/XXXLevelSet => more LevelSets can share the same graphic theme

Default theme (there is a theme called DefaultTheme; it's a theme of DefaultCampaign, so all the nested levels inherit names from it)

Convert all the Monster test locations to the new location standard (with no PASSWORD file and with location.xml)
