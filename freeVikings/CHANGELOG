[12.December 2008]
- viking.rb, monstermixins.rb:
  'a.XX_on_rect(r).each {}' replaced by 'a.XX_on_rect(r) {}' (less iterations -
  new feature of SchwerEngine::Group)
- utils/tiletester.rb: repaired

[11.December 2008]
- trying to solve problem with exitting from Ladder testing level I looked 
  at code of class Exit, added width and height (so that exit area is not
  just the top-left corner, but whole area of the image) and rewrote method 
  Exit#team_exited?, which was awfully uneffective
- added climbing states to models of Olaf and Baleog (although I haven't
  painted special images for them because graphics of vikings should
  be replaced as soon as possible)  
- viking.rb: viking stops moving horizontally before he starts climbing
  (bug fix)
- sophisticatedspritestate.rb: modified method SophisticatedSpriteState#rising?
  so that it returns false when viking is climbing; then he doesn't fall when
  he hits ceiling while climbing, just stops
- gamestate.rb: if development magic is on, F9 kills active viking (sadistic,
  but sometimes useful...)
- game.rb: fix bug which caused crash after the last viking was killed with F9

[7.December 2008]
- sprinter.rb, sophisticatedspritestate.rb: Erik is able again to jump
  when he is walking
- location.rb, viking.rb, shield.rb, sprinter.rb, warior.rb, shielder.rb: 
  added support for z (layer index) (-> shield never more disappears behind 
  other static objects, but fps is probably decreased a bit)
- switch.rb, teleport.rb, helpbutton.rb: methods 'activate' and 'deactivate'
  receive argument
- helpbutton.rb: RD->RDoc
- ladder.rb: code finished (Ladder is ActiveObject now)
- viking.rb, verticalstate.rb, horizontalstate.rb, gamestate.rb:
  Vikings can climb up and down on a ladder.
- Ladder testing level modified (two more ladders, exit achievable only
  by climbing two of them)

[4.December 2008]
- bottompanel.rb, bottompanelstate.rb: "keyboard-driven exchange of items" 
  has more proper visual representation (biggest displaying bug fixed);
  It is impossible to go into ItemsExchange mode if the active viking has 
  nothing to give
- shielder.rb: Shield disappears after Olaf's death

[28.November 2008]
- bottompanel.rb, bpvikingview.rb, game.rb, gamestate.rb, inventory.rb:
  after hours of work BottomPanel is repaired after reconstruction;
  it isn't cleaner, but has new Ingo's trash and highlighting of item
  exchange participants;
  the only known bug now is in displaying of old-school (keyboard driven)
  item transaction
- TODO: added screenshot key description
- added three new versions of Ingo's teleport graphics


[27.November 2008]
- DefaultTheme is theme of TestsCampaign

[25.November 2008]
- shielder.rb: doesn't add Shield to NullLocation
- gamestate.rb, game.rb: Screenshot taking (I had to implement this to be able
  to take screenshots of bomb explosion because I wasn't able to catch it
  with ImageMagick's 'import')

[24.November 2008]
- sophisticatedspritestate.rb: RD->RDoc
- location.rb: Location#find_surface
- viking.rb: New descending mechanism (using Location#find_surface);
  error "1px under viking fixed not considered error any more;
  fixed by making collision rect 1px lower"
- monsters/cottage.rb: made semi-solid (first semi-solid object in the game)
- shielder.rb, shield.rb: Shield changed from Sprite to semi-solid
  StaticObject; works better now (vikings don't fall through it)
- sprinter.rb Sprinter#space_func_on: fixed error "Erik can't jump from shield"
  and caused two new errors
- RubyCampaign/Intro: start moved 10px up

[23.November 2008]
- viking.rb: Viking#collision_rect is smaller than Viking#paint_rect (it's
  70px wide now)
- game.rb, location.rb: one huge blit operation replaced with clipping;
  unfortunatelly it didn't increase frame rate... :(
- game.rb: Game#paint_loading_screen - progressbar doesn't go behind window 
  frame

[16.November 2008]
- sprinter.rb: fixed a piece of dirt from yesterday
- game.rb: fixed method visibility after yesterday's cleanup
- ladder.rb + testing level + graphic: beginning of a new game object

  optional (switching with both option and menu)

  other events are state independent and as such are served directly
  in Game#every_frame

[15.November 2008]

- vikingstate.rb, horizontalstate.rb, verticalstate.rb: RD -> RDoc
- game.rb: methods divided into categories m
- gfx/vikings/erik/erik_bullhead_*.tga: awful scratches of erik using his
  "D ability" - "Bullhead"

[12.November 2008]
- game.rb: possibility to cancel loading of a level (press Escape)
- bomb.rb: Flame is animated; destruction is done by Flame, not by
  BombSprite
- wall.rb: animated destruction

[6.November 2008]

- bomb.rb: Bomb has a visible flame
- docs/develop_guide/ : on Monday or so I worked on the Developer's guide

[1.November 2008]
- bomb.rb: bomb only kills Heroes and Monsters, not all sprites;
           fired bombs are forced to explode

  it just kills vikings and other sprites, in future it will also destroy
  walls)

[30.October 2008]

  drag&drop item exchange
- initfv.rb: possibility to switch sound on/off from menu

[29.October 2008]
- transporter.rb, monsters/lift.rb: Fixed "lift down problem":
  Transporter#update_transported_sprites divided into two methods,
  because Transporters, which move transported sprites also in y-axis,
  have to move themselves between updating list of transported sprites
  and moving them in order to ensure that area to which transported sprites 
  are moved is already free at the time of the operation
- added testing level using Tiled map with tiles 32x32 px (works well without
  any additional modifications to SchwerEngine)

[28.October 2008]

- gamestate.rb: Possibility to select viking/item also in other states than
  PlayingGameState
- Location#display_rect

  to check it's rect (includes new "monster" TestRect)
- Viking#descend_onto_ground modified because "map dirty thing problem" 
  has been solved (after cca four years of being ignored)
- freevikings.rb: develmagic accessible only in development version

  of StructuredWorld.new;

- story.rb: added message "press Esc to skip" to storyframes
- FreeVikings.valid_location_password -> Level.valid_level_password?

[13.October 2008]
- tests: removed TestTiledMapLoadStrategy and associated data, 'lib/' added
  to $:, errors in TestTalk fixed;
  test source files aren't listed in tests/test.rb, but found at the time 
  of execution (in the same way as in Test::Unit::AutoRunner)

[6.October 2008]

  yesterday while I was preparing archive for release; today I removed
  one temporary modification made yesterday because of this problem
- locs/Tests.../Tiled../MultiLayer2 - testing location for new Map
  features planned for SchwerEngine::Map2

[[[release 0.6] [10/01/2008] ----------------------------------------

[1.October 2008]
- utils/make_release.rb: modifications because of moving package depository
  to SourceForge

[30.September 2008]
- freevikings.rb: fixed error in safe Log4r loading (I misanderstood
  return values of Kernel::require - it returns false if the library
  has already been loaded and raises LoadError if it cannot be loaded)
- User's manual: chapter Troubleshooting
- Development guide: some 'link's changed to 'xref's
- utils/make_release.rb: gameui and schwerengine won't be distributed as
  separate packages, but inside freeVikings archive; 
  work on interactive mode started

[29.September 2008]
- Added directory lib/ (for 'redistributed' libraries -
  currently gameui, schwerengine and script)
- freevikings.rb: safe RUDL loading (checks for RubyGems and bypasses them
  if needed)

- README: changed dependencies section (removed script, added note
  about it being redistributed)

[27.September 2008]

  colour);

- gamestate.rb: password displayed at the beginning of level has black 
  background again
- I have written first few paragraphs of User's manual

[25.September 2008]
- game.rb, location.rb: Game#is_exit? -> Location#exitted?
- DefaultCampaign/ArcticLevelSet/SwitchPlace: class IceBoard made a subclass
  of Entity (in order to provide it with methods paint_rect and collision_rect)
- exit.rb: docs RD->RDoc
- location.rb: added 'event handlers' on_beginning, on_exit;
  modified exit conditions
- RubyCampaign/Intro: on_beginning and on_exit handlers start Stories;
- RubyCampaign/Intro, story.rb: TalkFrame class moved to story.rb (it seems 
  useful)
- game.rb: fixed error "uncaught exception at the end of world";
  end-of-world-screen removed (removed method Game#end_of_game) - every 
  campaign should make it's own (by setting on_exit handler in the last
  level)
- DefaultCampaign/NucLabs/YellowHall: New end-of-world Story.
(Uff, two items disappeared from TODO, three or four new ones are there...)

[23.September 2008]
- locationloader.rb: I found out that SyntaxError isn't subclass
  of StandardError, but of ScriptError; so I extended the rescue clause...
- monsters/cottage.rb: simple StaticObject, vikings' cottage
- monsters/boat.rb: speed-up
- RubyCampaign/Intro/intro_script: cottages, door, key, lock
- RubyCampaign/levelsuite.rb: Assembler commented out
- game.rb: FPS displaying fixed (no unreal high numbers)

[20.September 2008]
- story.rb: A new way to tell the game story (I have been thinking about
  something similar for a long time, but now I need it...)
- RubyCampaign/Intro: Removed initial talk and mobile phone.
  It is more secure to tell the campaign legend using a Story.
- location.rb, game.rb, gamestate.rb: Support for Story

[18.September 2008]
- transporter.rb, monsters/flyingplatform.rb: A bit more code 
  from FlyingPlatform in Transporter
- monsters/boat.rb: Boat finished. First class working with different
  paint_rect and collision_rect (rect == collision_rect) !
- RubyCampaign/Intro: lift deleted, boat set up, exit moved

[17.September 2008]
- transporter.rb : mixin module (methods extracted from FlyingPlatform)
- monsters/boat.rb: Boat. Not finished. Needs Entity#collision_rect
  and Entity#paint_rect to be implemented first...

[16.September 2008]
- StructuredWorld#next_location removed
- game.rb: FPS printing modified (fill instead of filled_rectangle)

  They work with TGA and PNG images, other formats not tried yet...
- RubyCampaign/Intro: phone_talk.rb: fixed bad speaker id.

[15.September 2008]
- talk.rb, talkable.rb: documentation changed to RDoc format;
  sentence textbox disappears after the user pushes SPACE or ENTER -
  not sooner and not later.
- structuredworld.rb: fixed bug "SW#next_level doesn't update @location"
- game.rb: Because problems in finishing of level occured and I wasn't
  able to solve them, I decided to clean Game#game_loop up. It helped.

[13.September 2008]
- Developer's guide: descriptive section of vikings' states (with images)
- levelsuite.rb, level.rb, structuredworld.rb:
  Possibility to load level without a levelsuite. Theme can be defined
  in location.xml (not only in levelsuite.xml)
  (I needed this to make it easier for new developers working with
  Level-making-tutorial from the developer's guide.)
- location.rb, game.rb, gamestate.rb, 
  locs/TestsCampaign/Monster.../Conversation:
  New talking engine (I think it's simpler and more Lost-Vikings-Like than 
  that used in locs/Tests../Monster../OrangeHead)
- Fixed MobilePhone (it didn't work because it didn't have
  WIDTH and HEIGHT constants set -> collision Rectangle was empty)

[11.September 2008]
- RubyCampaign/Intro: 
    - conversations written
- location.rb and nullocation.rb moved back from SchwerEngine to freeVikings,
  because they aren't general enough and are messy.
  I also converted their documentation.
- team.rb: documentation converted, Team#[] modified,
  recursive calls in methods 'next' and 'previous' replaced by cycles
- Repaired WideBridge (private class of level ArcticTutorial)
- game.rb, gamestate.rb, location.rb: team moved from Game to Location
- deadviking.rb: modification because of changes in NullLocation
- talk.rb: Data validation should work better
- locationloader.rb: StandardError is caught from the script (instead of
  just RuntimeError and SyntaxError)

[10.September 2008]
- GameUI::Menu : menu window being killed raises an exception, which
  leads to termination of the game (so it is possible to leave game menu
  not only by pressing QuitButton, but also by pressing 'X' button 
  of the window)
- Log4r is just optional. (mocklog4r.rb hacks it around)
- One help in level DefaultCampaign/ArcticTutorial updated
- Possibility to switch sound off
- game.rb: fixed music bug (music started only if you switched password 
  displaying off)
- monsters/mobilephone.rb
- RubyCampaign/Intro: temporarily out-of-order: I must finish MobilePhone
  and write the talk-files.

[8.September 2008]
- monsters/piranha.rb: new monster
- modified RubyCampaign/Intro map and script
- image for boat

[6.September 2008]
- possibility to move through gameui menu simply having a key pressed
  (not needed to press a key again and again)
- mouse support in gameui menu
- Caught some more exceptions during loading of a location
  (locationloader.rb and tiledmaploadstrategy.rb)
- Lock documentation ported to RDoc
- RubyCampaign/Intro level totally changed
- new tileset (coast of the sea)
- Bridge and Lift classes modified (inheritance, behavior of Bridge)
- Bridge is now themed object
- method StaticObject#unregister_in created

[4.September 2008]
- world.rb removed (class World was replaced by subclass StructuredWorld;
  useless superclass removed now)
- tested replacement of Log4r by an empty mockclass, but it didn't speed up
  the game
- Added music support (it is possible to choose music for level in it's
  'location.xml')

[3.September 2008]
- levelsuite.rb: new methods LevelSuite#title and LevelSuite#methods.
  Active member isn't shifted out of Array @members, but just signed
  (variable @active_member_i)
- level.rb: documentation RD -> RDoc; new method Level#title;
- initfv.rb: in the development version it is possible to choose a level
  from a list (you don't need to remember the password)

[2.September 2008]
- Written whole new part of the development guide; guide splitted into
  several files. Successfull XSL transformation using
  xsltproc and XSL templates from http://docbook.sourceforge.net

[1.September 2008]
- Finished auto-releasing tool (utils/make_release.rb), which automates
  nearly everything connected with making a new release
  (creating and uploading packages, updating freshmeat and RAA)
- structuredworld.rb: documentation converted RD -> RDoc
- levelsuite.rb: documentation converted RD -> RDoc

[[[release 0.6-pre3] -----------------------------------------------------
  (Well, it isn't much different from 0.6pre2, but I wanted to test
  the auto-releasing tool)

[30.August 2008]
- README in the main development branch (it's a bit boring to make a new one
  for every release...)
- Nearly finished auto-releasing tool.

[28. August 2008]
- TiledMapLoadStrategy modified so that it can load both map0.99a (Tiled 0.6) 
  and map0.1 (Tiled 0.7) maps. Documentation converted from RD to RDoc
- Teleport created (class + tests + testing level)
- level RubyCampaign/Assembler improved a bit (teleports in dark blue rooms,
  door from room 1 to room 5 (light blue))

[23.August 2008]
- game.rb: RD documentation converted to RDoc
- SchwerEngine and Log4r are loaded AFTER processing commandline options -> 
  I will never more wait 10 seconds before I see help...
- help is generated from the Array of options - it isn't needed to modify HELP 
  whenever a new option is added; HELP contains just a part of what is shown 
  when you type 'freevikings.rb -h'
- I made something which one day may become level of a new campaign

[[[release 0.6-pre2] -----------------------------------------------------

[21.August 2008]
- Distinguish licensing clearly
- Select and move items between inventories using the mouse.
- Inventories which can be accessed (because their owners are next to the 
  active viking) should be somehow emphasized.

[16.August 2008]
Add something like "Authors" or "Credits" to main menu

[7.August 2008]
Possibility to turn off showing the password at the beginning of the level 
(which is a bit annoying e.g. during the development)

[16.July 2008]
- Possibility to skip menu
- 'Close' button ('X') causes total end of the game (as usually wanted 
  by the user) and not only return to the main menu

Theme definition (theme.xml) in gfx/themes/XXXTheme, not 
in locs/DefaultCampaign/XXXLevelSet => more LevelSets can share the same 
graphic theme

Default theme (there is a theme called DefaultTheme; it's a theme 
of DefaultCampaign, so all the nested levels inherit names from it)

Convert all the Monster test locations to the new location standard 
(with no PASSWORD file and with location.xml)
