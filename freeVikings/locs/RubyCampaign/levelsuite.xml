      It was just another boring sunday afternoon and the three friends were
      sunbathing on the coast of the Arctic ocean, while Baleog's mobile phone
      rang.
      Baleog: "Hello, it's Baleog."
      Man on the phone: "...really, the lost tool is priceless. I will buy you 
      as much meat as you will be able to eat or take home..."
      Olaf: "Baleog, tell him I have a van."
      Baleog: "We will come with a van. A huge van."
      Man: "Doesn't matter. Please, come and help me."
