Description:

A DOS game 'Lost Vikings' clonned using the Ruby 
programming language.
Guide the three viking friends, Eric, Baleog and Olaf,
through chambers full of enemies. Find and kill Tomator,
the galagtic devil collecting interesting forms of life.

Game controls:

move the viking left and right - cursor keys
switch between the vikings     - PgUp or Ctrl
release the arrow (Baleog only)- d
jump (Eric only)               - space

Options:

--help		-h	Prints out this help and halts.
--fullscreen    -f      Starts the game in the fullscreen mode
--extensions	-x	Uses compiled C++ extensions instead of some of the
			critical classes. You must have built these extensions 
			to use this option successfully.
--fps		-F	Prints frames per second on the game screen
--profile 	-p	Profiling (only for development)

At the end of the argument list you can append a list of filenames (relative 
to the directory locs!) of location files. You can mix up your own world 
in this way.

E.g.: freevikings.rb first_loc.xml hopsy_loc.xml

This example starts a special game built of levels from locs/first_loc.xml and
locs/hopsy_loc.xml.
