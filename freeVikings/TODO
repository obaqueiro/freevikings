           ===========================================
           ========== FreeVikings TODO file ==========
           ===========================================

======== Code ==========================================================

(-) Errors in levels
    (-) Non-fatal error in level is also reported to the player, not only 
        to the console and log
        (-) show error message
            (-) develop GameUI menu item which shows long scrollable text

(-) Level data (in location.xml)
    (-) Possibility to define starting point for each viking separately
        (prototyping levels started in TestsCampaign!)
    (-) Possibility to choose which viking will be active on level start

(-) Find new official font instead of Adlibn

(-) add Ingo's title to menu

(-) some problem in SophisticatedSpriteState (e.g. in levels with snail) 
    - fix it

(-) resource manager ( => no image is loaded twice etc. );
    it should have mechanism to mark resource as undeletable (images always
    used for UI)

(-) viking.rb: re-enable game speed feature after the test of speed

(-) New VikingState
    (-) particular states aren't implemented as classes, but as a small bunch 
        of data;
        when changing state, prepared singleton is taken, not a newly created 
        object
    (-) remove modification of VikingState internals from Viking subclasses 
        (e.g. Warior & Sprinter assign VikingState#horizontal_state)
    (-) code saying which state can come after which should be
        in VikingState OR in Viking subclasses, not in both
    (-) there should be something like state table which says which states
        can follow after each other
    (-) test that Baleog can't use his abilities while climbing a Ladder
    (-) fix all sophisticated sprites (Snail, Penguin, Robot)

(-) ZSortedGroup has two responsibilities in Location
    (1. keep sorted set of objects for painting and 2. keep track of
     "multiple-present objects": objects which are e.g. Sprite and StaticObject
     at the same time) - either rename the class or split it into two

(-) In-game menu doesn't have effect on fps value

(-) Web:
    (-) Fix links width ("Documentation" shouldn't exceed the frame)
    (-) Replace that ancient Baleog's graphic under the links
    (-) Classify links (General, Development)
    (-) RSS feed of news on CVS (anyone can easily track project activity)
        (it's possible that we can use some of SF's services for this?)

(-) Speed up tombstone animation

(-) Fix tests

(-) Wall/monster-smashing feature
    (-) bomb's flame can't reach behind wall or shield

(-) Great Testing Level
    When I test some core feature (e.g. modifications in VikingState),
    I usually do it by playing some level, most usually ATUT.
    But there should be some level with as many different objects as possible,
    to be able to test vikings in many ways.

(-) SchwerEngine::Model::ModelLoader should catch XML syntax errors and
    report them in a clever way.

(-) [GO] press(es)

(-) Code of class Sword is very strange and should be cleaned;
    fix Sword's Z

(-) Shield: Shield shouldn't kill shots, but shots should destroy themselves
    when they hit Shield

(-) Paralaxed background (optional) - owners of strong computers
    may appreciate a way to use up their powerfull processors...

(-) method Entity.location_handlers() which accepts one or more Symbol 
    arguments and creates register_in and unregister_in methods
    use:
    class MyBear < Sprite
      location_handlers :sprite, :static_object
    end

(-) remove never more used graphics (they just make archives big and
    cause confusement when someone looks into gfx/)

(-) create CVS module for miniruby

(-) create spritesheets from one-per-frame images;
    remove mirroring (mirrored version easily made by Surface#mirror_x)

(-) MasterPhW's objections
    (-) it's confusing if monsters are killed (often accidentally -
        MasterPhW couldn't find the first bear) when they aren't on the screen

(-) LevelSuite data loaded at application start (or when some levelsuite
    is first requested), not at start of every game;
    quicker searching for level with given password (internal Hash in 
    LevelSuite?)

(-) [GO] Olaf's van: all vikings can be inside but just Olaf can drive it;
    it only moves when it has enough fuel; it has attributes similar to Olaf
    (vikings can stay on it's deck; monsters can't pass through it - really?)

(-) clean freevikings.rb up, especially loading of configs

(-) GameUI::Menu, MenuItem: rename height and expanded_height
    to item_height and menu_height (both variables and reader methods)

(-) repair megahIte

(-) release tool:
    (-) sftp file to SF
    (-) option of of basing release on some non-HEAD branch
    (-) create user's manual (! update it's location in README !)
    (-) add winbin creation
        (but it should print a huge warning that winbin package shouldn't be 
         uploaded without previous test on Windows :) )
    (-) release tool: add task: mail to freevikings-users mailing list
    (-) release tool: option -P to checkout (ommit empty directories)

(-) Small levels (like RubyCampaign/Intro with panel on the side) paint well -
    unused part of the screen might be e.g. black

(-) Piranhas: some randomness (they shouldn't bite all at the same time and
    have the same speed)

(-) Rename Killtoy to Mjolnir?

(-) Config file
    (-) game configurability
        (-) configurable keys
        (-) warp/smooth switching

(-) High scores:
    (-) how much time it took to make a level
    (-) optionally level times could be viewed after finishing a level
    (-) highscores on the website

(-) [UI] Menu issues:
    (-) Menu scrolls if it is too long
    (-) Widget for selecting a file or folder
    (-) Menu: add a message if a bad password is given (also to the GUI,
        not only to a console)
    (-) password input works well with mouse
    (-) Possibility to change keys (movement, inventory control etc.)
    (-) add campaigns

(-) Speech boxes should be placed in some cleverer way, so that all text
    is visible (try to talk while standing at the end of map)

(-) Trolls
    (-) Why don't trolls in HappyLEnd get angry?
    (-) Troll shouldn't go through the door... (try Christmas2008/HolyHole...)
    (-) Trolls should attack Olaf's shield

(-) Model: if unknown state occurs, just log an error message and don't
    raise exception (or possibility to switch off exception)

(-) Possibility to load images from level directory

(-) Fix BottomPanel
    (-) select box can blink in trash (it may be solved by creating
        additional team in BottomPanel, which would be used in ItemsExchange
        state and would include Trash)

(-) Game speed
    (-) Possibility to change game speed (useful on newer machines, where 
        vikings move terribly slowly)
        It is in options (-v) and vikings move quicker then, 
        but not the monsters!
    (-) Increase default game speed
    (-) Code (option-switchable) which tests for highest possible game speed
        at given frame rate

(-) Vikings remember the surface they are standing on so that it isn't 
    necessary to check for fall in every iteration of frame cycle

(-) Pause game on focus loss (should be just option -
    it spares cpu time, but someone may not want this behavior)

(-) Support for "tileset images" into "poor fV XML maps"?

(-) Redesign VikingState (current design is pretty useless and immature)

(-) [GO] LivingStone - animate all frames properly, finish code

(-) [DOC] Create manpage of freeVikings

(-) [UI] error in script is shown in kind of dialog window

(-) Viking's rect isn't constant, but may have variable size and
    is dependent on image used (display rect defined in model file
    for every image?)

(-) Entity#init_images should be something like protected (I don't know 
    exactly what 'protected' means IN RUBY; maybe it should be even private
    and called using instance_eval)

(-) Transporter tasks
    (-) Transporter: Transporter doesn't search for Transportables,
        but vice versa: Transportables register at the Transporter when 
        they find him
    (-) Transporter#update_transported_sprites: less cycles

(-) Clean up SchwerEngine: some better configuration then through global 
    constant GFX_DIR etc.

(-) [VI] Better - more realistic - physics (jumping etc.)

(-) Set up some check for new releases of libraries we are using
    (RUDL, script, Log4r, REXML)

(-) Variable number of heroes (from 1 up to 4?); more heroes
    (aside of Fang and Scorch from Lost Vikings 2 I would like to add at least
    one totally new hero - Olaf's wife Hildegard);
    Heroes are defined in location.xml; possibility to modify team on-the-fly
    from inside level

(-) [UI] Add some 'video' (e.g. viking's funeral as in LV1) on level restart

(-) Move all requirement stuff to one file (freevikings.rb), so that it can be 
    controlled easily

(-) Remove StaticObject#unregister_in;
    instead, add Entity#unregister (without argument, every Entity will have
    reference of the Location)

(-) [UI] Show level name, description and author at the beginning of level

(-) File.open in the script should receive address relative to level directory

(-) [GO] Some teleporting animation
    (It's possible to implement it as a Sprite,   e.g. Teleport::Animation)

(-) Game objects which weren't given any theme should wait till they are
    registered in a location and try to get it's theme - not raise exception

(-) Installation

(-) [DT] Complex tutorial level set

(-) developer's manual: finish level tutorial

(-) RDoc documentation (convert RD to RDoc)

(-) Repair RUDL:  Music.post_end_event shouldn't require argument
    and event should be sent if set to true and music ends

(-) release tool: add task: post file to SF

======== Funny but useless features ====================================

(-) When doing nothing vikings show how much they are bored. After cca ten
    minutes they fall asleep. From time to time they wake up, say something
    and fall asleep again.

(-) Voice of Thor

============= TASK TYPE CODES:

[GO] game objects
[VI] vikings
[UI] user interface and related stuff
[DT] data (maps, pictures, scripts, ...)
