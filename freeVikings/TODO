           ========== FreeVikings TODO file ==========
           ===========================================

======== Code ==========================================================

(-) Wall/monster-smashing feature
    (-) bomb's flame can't reach behind wall or shield

(-) New VikingState
    (-) there should be something like state table which says which states
        can follow after each other
    (-) remove modification of VikingState internals from Viking subclasses 
        (e.g. Warior & Sprinter assign VikingState#horizontal_state)
    (-) test that Baleog can't use his abilities while climbing a Ladder
    (-) fix Snail
    (-) code saying which state can come after which should be
        in VikingState OR in Viking subclasses, not in both

(-) Web:
    (-) Fix links width ("Documentation" shouldn't exceed the frame)
    (-) Replace that ancient Baleog's graphic under the links
    (-) Classify links (General, Development)

(-) Speed up tombstone animation

(-) Fix tests

(-) Great Testing Level
    When I test some core feature (e.g. modifications in VikingState),
    I usually do it by playing some level, most usually ATUT.
    But there should be some level with as many different objects as possible,
    to be able to test vikings in many ways.

(-) Pulling
    (-) vikings can pull some objects
        - walking viking, when he can't walk on, start's pulling instead of
          just stopping
    (-) [GO] Pullable block 80*80px

(-) SchwerEngine::Model::ModelLoader should catch XML syntax errors and
    report them in a clever way.

(-) [GO] press(es)

(-) Code of class Sword is very strange and should be cleaned;
    fix Sword's Z

(-) Shield: Shield should't kill shots, but shots should destroy themselves
    when they hit Shield

(-) method Entity.location_handlers() which accepts one or more Symbol 
    arguments and creates register_in and unregister_in methods
    use:
    class MyBear < Sprite
      location_handlers :sprite, :static_object
    end

(-) remove never more used graphics (they just make archives big and
    cause confusement when someone looks into gfx/)

(-) create CVS module for miniruby

(-) create spritesheets from one-per-frame images;
    remove mirroring (mirrored version easily made by Surface#mirror_x)

(-) MasterPhW's objections
    (-) it's confusing if monsters are killed (often accidentally -
        MasterPhW couldn't find the first bear) when they aren't on the screen

(-) LevelSuite data loaded at application start (or when some levelsuite
    is first requested), not at start of every game;
    quicker searching for level with given password (internal Hash in 
    LevelSuite?)

(-) [GO] Olaf's van: all vikings can be inside but just Olaf can drive it;
    it only moves when it has enough fuel; it has attributes similar to Olaf
    (vikings can stay on it's deck; monsters can't pass through it - really?)

(-) clean freevikings.rb up, especially loading of configs

(-) GameUI::Menu, MenuItem: rename height and expanded_height
    to item_height and menu_height (both variables and reader methods)

(-) repair megahIte

(-) release tool:
    (-) sftp file to SF
    (-) option of of basing release on some non-HEAD branch
    (-) create user's manual (! update it's location in README !)
    (-) add winbin creation
        (but it should print a huge warning that winbin package shouldn't be 
         uploaded without previous test on Windows :) )
    (-) release tool: add task: mail to freevikings-users mailing list
    (-) release tool: option -P to checkout (ommit empty directories)

(-) Small levels (like RubyCampaign/Intro with panel on the side) paint well -
    unused part of the screen might be e.g. black

(-) In-game menu doesn't have effect on fps value

(-) Piranhas: some randomness (they shouldn't bite all at the same time and
    have the same speed)

(-) Rename Killtoy to Mjolnir?

(-) Config file
    (-) game configurability
        (-) configurable keys
        (-) warp/smooth switching

(-) High scores:
    (-) how much time it took to make a level
    (-) optionally level times could be viewed after finishing a level
    (-) highscores on the website

(-) [UI] Menu issues:
    (-) Menu scrolls if it is too long
    (-) Widget for selecting a file or folder
    (-) Menu: add a message if a bad password is given (also to the GUI,
        not only to a console)
    (-) password input works well with mouse
    (-) Possibility to change keys (movement, inventory control etc.)
    (-) add campaigns

(-) Speech boxes should be placed in some cleverer way, so that all text
    is visible (try to talk while standing at the end of map)

(-) Trolls
    (-) Why don't trolls in HappyLEnd get angry?
    (-) Troll shouldn't go through the door... (try Christmas2008/HolyHole...)
    (-) Trolls should attack Olaf's shield

(-) Model: if unknown state occurs, just log an error message and don't
    raise exception (or possibility to switch off exception)

(-) Possibility to load images from level directory

(-) Fix BottomPanel
    (-) select box can blink in trash (it may be solved by creating
        additional team in BottomPanel, which would be used in ItemsExchange
        state and would include Trash)

(-) Game speed
    (-) Possibility to change game speed (useful on newer machines, where 
        vikings move terribly slowly)
        It is in options (-v) and vikings move quicker then, 
        but not the monsters!
    (-) Increase default game speed
    (-) Code (option-switchable) which tests for highest possible game speed
        at given frame rate

(-) Vikings remember the surface they are standing on so that it isn't 
    necessary to check for fall in every iteration of frame cycle

(-) Pause game on focus loss (should be just option -
    it spares cpu time, but someone may not want this behavior)

(-) Support for "tileset images" into "poor fV XML maps"?

(-) Redesign VikingState (current design is pretty useless and immature)

(-) [GO] LivingStone - animate all frames properly, finish code

(-) [DOC] Create manpage of freeVikings

(-) [UI] error in script is shown in kind of dialog window

(-) Viking's rect isn't constant, but may have variable size and
    is dependent on image used (display rect defined in model file
    for every image?)

(-) Entity#init_images should be something like protected (I don't know 
    exactly what 'protected' means IN RUBY; maybe it should be even private
    and called using instance_eval)

(-) Transporter tasks
    (-) Transporter: Transporter doesn't search for Transportables,
        but vice versa: Transportables register at the Transporter when 
        they find him
    (-) Transporter#update_transported_sprites: less cycles

(-) Clean up SchwerEngine: some better configuration then through global 
    constant GFX_DIR etc.

(-) [VI] Better - more realistic - physics (jumping etc.)

(-) Set up some check for new releases of libraries we are using
    (RUDL, script, Log4r, REXML)

(-) Variable number of heroes (from 1 up to 4?); more heroes
    (aside of Fang and Scorch from Lost Vikings 2 I would like to add at least
    one totally new hero - Olaf's wife Hildegard);
    Heroes are defined in location.xml; possibility to modify team on-the-fly
    from inside level

(-) [UI] Add some 'video' (e.g. viking's funeral as in LV1) on level restart

(-) Move all requirement stuff to one file (freevikings.rb), so that it can be 
    controlled easily

(-) Remove StaticObject#unregister_in;
    instead, add Entity#unregister (without argument, every Entity will have
    reference of the Location)

(-) [UI] Show level name, description and author at the beginning of level

(-) File.open in the script should receive address relative to level directory

(-) [GO] Some teleporting animation
    (It's possible to implement it as a Sprite,   e.g. Teleport::Animation)

(-) Possibility to define starting point for each viking separately

(-) Game objects which weren't given any theme should wait till they are
    registered in a location and try to get it's theme - not raise exception

(-) Installation

(-) Skinnable vikings

(-) [DT] Complex tutorial level set

(-) developer's manual: finish level tutorial

(-) RDoc documentation (convert RD to RDoc)

(-) Items autouse (healing items mainly) as in LV2 (only as option)

(-) Repair RUDL:  Music.post_end_event shouldn't require argument
    and event should be sent if set to true and music ends

(-) release tool: add task: post file to SF

======== Funny but useless features ====================================

(-) When doing nothing vikings show how much they are bored. After cca ten
    minutes they fall asleep. From time to time they wake up, say something
    and fall asleep again.

(-) Voice of Thor

============= TASK TYPE CODES:

[GO] game objects
[VI] vikings
[UI] user interface and related stuff
[DT] data (maps, pictures, scripts, ...)
