           ========== FreeVikings TODO file ==========
           ===========================================

======== To be done: ==========================================================

(-) Convert all the Monster test locations to the new location standard
    (with no PASSWORD file and with location.xml)

(-) Finish graphics of the vikings

(-) Make all setup stuff accessible from the menu

(-) User's (and system?) configuration file with possibility to define
    multiple location storage places

(-) Installation

(-) Skinnable vikings

(-) Complex tutorial level set

(-) User's manual

(-) Level developer's manual

(-) RDoc documentation

======== Already finished: ====================================================

(+) Theme definition (theme.xml) in gfx/themes/XXXTheme, 
    not in locs/DefaultCampaign/XXXLevelSet => more LevelSets can share 
    the same graphic theme

(+) Default theme (there is a theme called DefaultTheme; it's a theme 
    of DefaultCampaign, so all the nested levels inherit names from it)
