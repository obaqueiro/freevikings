           ========== FreeVikings TODO file ==========
           ===========================================

======== To be done: ==========================================================

(-) Distinguish licensing clearly

(-) Select and move items between inventories using the mouse.
    Make it possible to delete items in the game (the possibility is in the
    class Inventory, but is not accessible for the player).

    !!! I prepared testing location with many items !!!

(-) Bomb

(-) Smashable wall (bomb/Erik's head)

(-) Erik's 'head-smash' feature

(-) User's (and system?) configuration file (with possibility to define
    multiple location storage places)

(-) Music

(-) Variable tile size (not only 40x40)

(-) Move all items to a separate directory items/ ?

(-) Repair the Snail (this monster seems to be out of order)

(-) Make all setup stuff accessible from the menu (e.g. define location 
    storage places, choose a campaign to be played etc.)

(-) Possibility to change game speed (useful on newer machines, where 
    vikings move terribly slowly)

(-) Installation

(-) Skinnable vikings

(-) Complex tutorial level set

(-) User's manual

(-) Level developer's manual

(-) RDoc documentation (convert RD to RDoc)

(-) Animated loading (e.g. some efects on the word "LOADING" or a progress bar)

(-) Development mode

(-) Process commandline options before loading huge data (it is annoying
    to wait so long before help is displayed after typing 'freevikings.rb -h')

======== Already finished: ====================================================

(+) Add something like "Authors" or "Credits" to main menu [16.August 2008]
(+) Possibility to turn off showing the password at the beginning of the level
    (which is a bit annoying e.g. during the development) [7.August 2008]
(+) Possibility to skip menu [16.July 2008]
(+) 'Close' button ('X') causes total end of the game (as usually wanted 
    by the user) and not only return to the main menu [16.July 2008]
(+) Theme definition (theme.xml) in gfx/themes/XXXTheme, 
    not in locs/DefaultCampaign/XXXLevelSet => more LevelSets can share 
    the same graphic theme
(+) Default theme (there is a theme called DefaultTheme; it's a theme 
    of DefaultCampaign, so all the nested levels inherit names from it)
(+) Convert all the Monster test locations to the new location standard
    (with no PASSWORD file and with location.xml)
