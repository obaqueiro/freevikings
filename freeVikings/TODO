           ===========================================
           ========== FreeVikings TODO file ==========
           ===========================================

======== RubyCampaign ==================================================

======== Graphics ======================================================

(-) Full spritesheets for all three vikings according to the developers'
    manual

(-) New graphic style of bottompanel (layout + images)

======== Code ==========================================================

(-) Trash: trash shows it has 'eaten' an item by animation

(-) High scores:
    (-) how much time it took to make a level
    (-) optionally level times could be viewed after finishing a level
    (-) highscores on the website

(-) Config file
    (-) design:
        (-) do we need a system-wide config? Probably not.
        (-) format: XML? YAML? Ruby script? INI-like? other?
        (-) structure
    (-) game configurability
        (-) configurable keys
        (-) bottompanel: divide events from actions:
            events:
              click, quick_click(second in double-click), release
              (each can be left/right/middle(button);
              on portrait, inventory, item, whole view)
            actions:
              select-viking, select-item, use-active-item, use-item, 
              delete-item, drag-item, drop-item

(-) [UI] Menu issues:
    (-) Menu scrolls if it is too long
    (-) Width of menu can be changed
    (-) Widget for selecting a file or folder
    (-) Menu: add a message if a bad password is given (also to the GUI,
        not only to a console)
    (-) Possibility to change keys (movement, inventory control etc.)
    (-) define location storage places, choose a campaign to be played

(-) [UI] Add dialog "Back to menu/Restart level/Cancel"

(-) Why don't trolls in HappyLEnd get angry?

(-) Speech boxes should be placed in some cleverer way, so that all text
    is visible (try to talk while standing at the end of map)

(-) Troll shouldn't go through the door... (try Christmas2008/HolyHole...)

(-) Two ways of reloading a level: everything (for map development etc)
    or just a script (map is preserved) - loading of some maps takes
    a lot of time

(-) Model: if unknown state occurs, just log an error message and don't
    raise exception (or possibility to switch off exception)

(-) Possibility to load images from level directory

(-) SchwerEngine: all rect versions should have methods move, move_y, move_x

(-) Fix BottomPanel
    (-) select box can blink in trash (it may be solved by creating
        additional team in BottomPanel, which would be used in ItemsExchange
        state and would include Trash)

(-) Game speed
    (-) Possibility to change game speed (useful on newer machines, where 
        vikings move terribly slowly)
        It is in options (-v) and vikings move quicker then, 
        but not the monsters!
    (-) Increase default game speed
    (-) Code (option-switchable) which tests for highest possible game speed
        at given frame rate

(-) Vikings remember the surface they are standing on so that it isn't 
    necessary to check for fall in every iteration of frame cycle

(-) Make compiled version of SchwerEngine::Rectangle (Profiling told me that
    program spends 
	14% of time in Rectangle#at (2530 calls), 
	8% in Rectangle#left (1272 calls)
	7% in Rectangle#collides (172 calls))
	etc.

(-) Pause game on focus loss, unpause on focus (should be just option -
    it spares cpu time, but someone may not want this behavior)

(-) Support for "tileset images" into "poor fV XML maps"?

(-) Redesign VikingState (current design is pretty useless and immature)

(-) Wall/monster-smashing feature
    (-) [VI] Erik's 'head-smash' feature (depends on rewriting VikingState -
             whole design of VikingState must be changed, because
             vertical and horizontal state can't be so much "standalone" -
             it leads to unknown states etc.)
    (-) bomb's flame can't reach behind wall or shield
    (-) Dropped bomb stops on a shield

(-) [GO] LivingStone - animate all frames properly, finish code

(-) [GO] Olaf's van: all vikings can be inside but just Olaf can drive it;
    it only moves when it has enough fuel; it has attributes similar to Olaf
    (vikings can stay on it's deck; monsters can't pass through it)

(-) [UI] error in script is shown in kind of dialog window

(-) Viking's rect isn't constant, but may have variable size and
    is dependent on image used (display rect defined in model file
    for every image?)

(-) Entity#init_images should be something like protected (I don't know 
    exactly what 'protected' means IN RUBY; maybe it should be even private
    and called using instance_eval)

(-) Transporter tasks
    (-) Transporter: Transporter doesn't search for Transportables,
        but vice versa: Transportables register at the Transporter when 
        they find him
    (-) Transporter#update_transported_sprites: less cycles

(-) Clean up SchwerEngine: some better configuration then through global 
    constant GFX_DIR etc.

(-) [VI] Better - more realistic - physics (jumping etc.)

(-) Set up some check for new releases of libraries we are using
    (RUDL, script, Log4r, REXML)

(-) Variable number of heroes (from 1 up to 4?); more heroes
    (aside of Fang and Scorch from Lost Vikings 2 I would like to add at least
    one totally new hero - Olaf's wife Hildegard);
    Heroes are defined in location.xml; possibility to modify team on-the-fly
    from inside level

(-) [UI] Add some "dead animation" on level restart

(-) Move all requirement stuff to one file (freevikings.rb), so that it can be 
    controlled easily

(-) Remove StaticObject#unregister_in;
    instead, add Entity#unregister (without argument, every Entity will have
    reference of the Location)

(-) [UI] Show level name, description and author at the beginning of level

(-) release tool: add task: mail to freevikings-users mailing list

(-) release tool: option -P to checkout (ommit empty directories)

(-) Map's borders are solid, so it is impossible to go out of the map

(-) File.open in the script should receive address relative to level directory

(-) [GO] Some teleporting animation
    (It's possible to implement it as a Sprite,   e.g. Teleport::Animation)

(-) Possibility to define starting point for each viking separately

(-) Game objects which weren't given any theme should wait till they are
    registered in a location and try to get it's theme - not raise exception

(-) Move all items to a separate directory items/ ?

(-) Installation

(-) Skinnable vikings

(-) [DT] Complex tutorial level set

(-) developer's manual: finish level tutorial

(-) RDoc documentation (convert RD to RDoc)

(-) Items autouse (healing items mainly) as in LV2 (only as option)

(-) Repair RUDL:  Music.post_end_event shouldn't require argument
    and event should be sent if set to true and music ends

(-) release tool: add task: post file to SF

======== Funny but useless features ====================================

(-) When doing nothing vikings show how much they are bored. After cca ten
    minutes they fall asleep. From time to time they wake up, say something
    and fall asleep again.

(-) Voice of Thor

============= TASK TYPE CODES:

[GO] game objects
[VI] vikings
[UI] user interface and related stuff
[DT] data (maps, pictures, scripts, ...)
