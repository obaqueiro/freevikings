           ===========================================
           ========== FreeVikings TODO file ==========
           ===========================================

======== To be done: ==========================================================

(-) Convert all the Monster test locations to the new location standard
    (with no PASSWORD file and with location.xml)

(-) Finish graphics of the vikings

(-) Make all setup stuff accessible from the menu (e.g. define location 
    storage places, choose a campaign to be played etc.)

(-) User's (and system?) configuration file with possibility to define
    multiple location storage places

(-) Installation

(-) Skinnable vikings

(-) Complex tutorial level set

(-) User's manual

(-) Level developer's manual

(-) RDoc documentation

(-) Animated loading (e.g. some efects on the word "LOADING" or a progress bar)

(-) Possibility to change game speed

(-) Development mode

(-) 'Close' button ('X') causes total end of the game (as usually wanted 
    by the user) and not only return to the main menu

======== Already finished: ====================================================

(+) Theme definition (theme.xml) in gfx/themes/XXXTheme, 
    not in locs/DefaultCampaign/XXXLevelSet => more LevelSets can share 
    the same graphic theme

(+) Default theme (there is a theme called DefaultTheme; it's a theme 
    of DefaultCampaign, so all the nested levels inherit names from it)
