           ===========================================
           ========== FreeVikings TODO file ==========
           ===========================================

======== To be finished for release 0.6 ================================

(-) Level password should have black background

(-) Respect \n in textbox creation

(-) User's manual

(-) release tool: add task: mail to freevikings-users mailing list

(-) release tool: interactive mode which asks before each task if it should
    be done.
    Maybe this mode should be the default one and the non-interactive one
    could be switched on using some option.
    Also a batch mode could be implemented - all input would have to be given
    in a file (XML; on the beginning it would be checked if it contains
    everything needed).

(-) release tool: add task: post file to SF (maybe it is impossible...)

======== RubyCampaign ==================================================

(-) Repair Assembler tileset (the black stripes are awful!)

(-) Finish Assembler level

======== Graphics ======================================================

(-) Some image for teleport (cca 80x120px)

(-) Vikings' house (cca 150x150px, just one type)

(-) Vikings' wifes (they can be similar or not, but should not be 
    all the same - it is enough if they have e.g. different colour
    of dress or hair)

(-) Vikings' children (they should be somehow similar to their dads/mums)

Wifes and children will be static, so they don't need walk cycles etc.

======== Code ==========================================================

(-) File.open in the script should receive address relative to level directory

(-) Olaf's shield shouldn't move awfully when Olaf's too quick

(-) Transporter#update_transported_sprites: less cycles

(-) Remove StaticObject#unregister_in;
    instead, add Entity#unregister (without argument, every Entity will have
    reference of the Location)

(-) Game objects which weren't given any theme should wait till they are
    registered in a location and try to get it's theme - not raise exception

(-) Repair RUDL:  Music.post_end_event shouldn't require argument
    and event should be sent if set to true and music ends

(-) Fix bug "not displayed first row of tiles"
    (See schwerengine/map.rb L75; find a similar thing in painting of
    game objects; remove both)
    Seems that old XML maps haven't got this problem.
    Let's "fix" it adding one empty line to Tiled maps :( - BAD IDEA.
    Seems that at least small maps haven't got this problem.

(-) Fix wrong displaying of map's last row

(-) Map's borders are solid, so it is impossible to go out of the map

(-) Some teleporting animation
    (It's possible to implement it as a Sprite,   e.g. Teleport::Animation)

(-) Vikings should rest on Olaf's shield only if it's over his head

(-) Show level name, description and author at the beginning of level

(-) Delete items using mouse: drag item and drop it over trash icon

(-) Visual drag&drop of items; highlighting

(-) Repair ArrowShooter

(-) Bomb

(-) Smashable wall (bomb/Erik's head)

(-) Erik's 'head-smash' feature

(-) Wait for key in a talk

(-) Possibility to define starting point for each viking separately

(-) User's (and system?) configuration file (with possibility to define
    multiple location storage places)

(-) Possibility to change keys (movement, inventory control etc.)

(-) Variable tile size (not only 40x40)

(-) Move all items to a separate directory items/ ?

(-) Repair the Snail (this monster seems to be out of order)

(-) Make all setup stuff accessible from the menu (e.g. define location 
    storage places, choose a campaign to be played etc.)

(-) Possibility to change game speed (useful on newer machines, where 
    vikings move terribly slowly)
    It is in options (-v) and vikings move quicker then, but not the monsters!

(-) Installation

(-) Skinnable vikings

(-) Complex tutorial level set

(-) developer's manual: finish level tutorial

(-) RDoc documentation (convert RD to RDoc)

(-) Animated loading (e.g. some efects on the word "LOADING" or a progress bar)

(-) Items autouse (healing items mainly) as in LV2

(-) Enable Tiled maps with more tileset images

(-) Clean up game.rb
