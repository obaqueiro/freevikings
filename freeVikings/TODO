           ===========================================
           ========== FreeVikings TODO file ==========
           ===========================================

======== RubyCampaign ==================================================

(-) [DT] Repair Assembler tileset (the black stripes are awful!)

(-) [DT] Finish Assembler level

======== Graphics ======================================================

(-) [DT] Some image for teleport (cca 80x120px)

======== Code ==========================================================

(-) [DT] Fix levels (from Stairs to Hell on)

(-) Fix going down with a lift (does bad things in Meadow level)

(-) Enable Tiled maps with more tileset images

(-) Variable tile size (not only 40x40) (it should be possible now -
    but I need some map to test if it's true)

(-) [VI] Better - more realistic - physics (jumping etc.)

(-) [UI] Visual drag&drop of items; highlighting

(-) Set up some check for new releases of libraries we are using
    (RUDL, script, Log4r, REXML)

(-) Less blit operations (replace huge blits with clipping) - it should
    increase frame rate

(-) [UI] Menu issues:

    (-) Menu: add a message if a bad password is given (also to the GUI,
        not only to a console)

    (-) Possibility to change keys (movement, inventory control etc.)

    (-) Switch on/off sound

    (-) Select levelsuite directory

(-) Shield tasks:

    (-) [VI] Olaf's shield shouldn't move awfully when Olaf's too quick

    (-) Transporter#update_transported_sprites: less cycles

    (-) [VI] Vikings should rest on Olaf's shield only if it's over his head

(-) Move all requirement stuff to one file (freevikings.rb), so that it can be 
    controlled easily

(-) Remove StaticObject#unregister_in;
    instead, add Entity#unregister (without argument, every Entity will have
    reference of the Location)

(-) [UI] Show level name, description and author at the beginning of level

(-) release tool: add task: mail to freevikings-users mailing list

(-) Map's borders are solid, so it is impossible to go out of the map

(-) File.open in the script should receive address relative to level directory

(-) [GO] Some teleporting animation
    (It's possible to implement it as a Sprite,   e.g. Teleport::Animation)

(-) [UI] Delete items using mouse: drag item and drop it over trash icon

(-) [GO] Repair ArrowShooter

(-) Wall/monster-smashing feature

    (-) [GO] Bomb

    (-) [GO] Smashable wall

    (-) [VI] Erik's 'head-smash' feature

(-) [GO] Ladder

(-) Possibility to define starting point for each viking separately

(-) [UI] User's (and system?) configuration file (with possibility to define
    multiple location storage places)

(-) Game objects which weren't given any theme should wait till they are
    registered in a location and try to get it's theme - not raise exception

(-) Move all items to a separate directory items/ ?

(-) [GO] Repair the Snail (this monster seems to be out of order)

(-) [UI] Make all setup stuff accessible from the menu (e.g. define location 
    storage places, choose a campaign to be played, music etc.)

(-) Possibility to change game speed (useful on newer machines, where 
    vikings move terribly slowly)
    It is in options (-v) and vikings move quicker then, but not the monsters!

(-) Installation

(-) Skinnable vikings

(-) [DT] Complex tutorial level set

(-) developer's manual: finish level tutorial

(-) RDoc documentation (convert RD to RDoc)

(-) Items autouse (healing items mainly) as in LV2 (only as option)

(-) Repair RUDL:  Music.post_end_event shouldn't require argument
    and event should be sent if set to true and music ends

(-) release tool: add task: post file to SF

============= TASK TYPE CODES:

[GO] game objects
[VI] vikings
[UI] user interface and related stuff
[DT] data (maps, pictures, scripts, ...)
