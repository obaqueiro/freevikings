           ===========================================

======== Graphics ======================================================

!!! TODO LIST FOR GRAPHICS MOVES !!!
while list of core features waiting for implementation remains here,
requests on graphics and other content move to the forum
(section Development > Graphics):
[http://freevikings.sourceforge.net/phpBB3/]

(-) Full spritesheets for all three vikings according to the developers'
    manual

(-) New graphic style of bottompanel (layout + images)

======== Code ==========================================================

(-) [GO] press(es)

(-) [GO] broken game objects
    (-) repair Wall (seems that it doesn't work)
    (-) repair FireballSpitter (in testing level 'to left' one works well,
        'to right' one doesn't)

(-) Credits not hard-coded, but loaded from a data file (even the one who isn't
    able to run freeVikings can see who contributed)

(-) method Entity.location_handlers() which accepts one or more Symbol 
    arguments and creates register_in and unregister_in methods
    use:
    class MyBear < Sprite
      location_handlers :sprite, :static_object
    end

(-) remove never more used graphics (they just make archives big and
    cause confusement when someone looks into gfx/)

(-) create spritesheets from one-per-frame images;
    remove mirroring (mirrored version easily made by Surface#mirror_x)

(-) MasterPhW's objections
    (-) user manual
        - release tool: build user's manual
        - README: link to user's manual
    (-) fix documentation about -d option and comments in configs
    (-) auto-fps-limiter
    (-) it's confusing if monsters are killed (often accidentally -
        MasterPhW couldn't find the first bear) when they aren't on the screen

(-) Rename README to README.txt (even an unexperienced user of Windows should 
    be able to read it);
    Update make_release.rb

(-) Rename LICENSES to LICENSES.txt (windows don't accept file LICENSES and
    subfolder licenses/ in one folder)

(-) LevelSuite data loaded at application start (or when some levelsuite
    is first requested), not at start of every game;
    quicker searching for level with given password (internal Hash in 
    LevelSuite?)

(-) Move EXIT in all levels

(-) Wall/monster-smashing feature
    (-) [VI] Erik's 'head-smash' feature (depends on rewriting VikingState -
             whole design of VikingState must be changed, because
             vertical and horizontal state can't be so much "standalone" -
             it leads to unknown states etc.)
    (-) bomb's flame can't reach behind wall or shield
    (-) Dropped bomb stops on a shield

(-) [GO] Olaf's van: all vikings can be inside but just Olaf can drive it;
    it only moves when it has enough fuel; it has attributes similar to Olaf
    (vikings can stay on it's deck; monsters can't pass through it - really?)

(-) Pulling
    (-) vikings can pull some objects
    (-) [GO] Pullable block 80*80px

(-) clean freevikings.rb up, especially loading of configs

(-) GameUI::Menu, MenuItem: rename height and expanded_height
    to item_height and menu_height (both variables and reader methods)

(-) Frame limit
    (-) Automatic frame limit (optional)
    (-) setup in menu (auto/off/fixed value)

(-) repair megahIte

(-) release tool:
    (-) sftp file to SF
    (-) option of of basing release on some non-HEAD branch
    (-) create user's manual

(-) Small levels (like RubyCampaign/Intro with panel on the side) paint well -
    unused part of the screen might be e.g. black

(-) In-game menu doesn't have effect on fps value

(-) Piranhas: some randomness (they shouldn't bite all at the same time and
    have the same speed)

(-) Rename Killtoy to Mjolnir?

(-) Config file
    (-) game configurability
        (-) configurable keys
        (-) warp/smooth switching

(-) High scores:
    (-) how much time it took to make a level
    (-) optionally level times could be viewed after finishing a level
    (-) highscores on the website

(-) [UI] Menu issues:
    (-) Menu scrolls if it is too long
    (-) Widget for selecting a file or folder
    (-) Menu: add a message if a bad password is given (also to the GUI,
        not only to a console)
    (-) Possibility to change keys (movement, inventory control etc.)
    (-) add campaigns
    (-) password input works well with mouse

(-) Speech boxes should be placed in some cleverer way, so that all text
    is visible (try to talk while standing at the end of map)

(-) Trolls
    (-) Why don't trolls in HappyLEnd get angry?
    (-) Troll shouldn't go through the door... (try Christmas2008/HolyHole...)
    (-) Trolls should attack Olaf's shield

(-) Two ways of reloading a level: everything (for map development etc)
    or just a script (map is preserved) - loading of some maps takes
    a lot of time

(-) Model: if unknown state occurs, just log an error message and don't
    raise exception (or possibility to switch off exception)

(-) Possibility to load images from level directory

(-) SchwerEngine: all rect versions should have methods move, move_y, move_x

(-) Fix BottomPanel
    (-) select box can blink in trash (it may be solved by creating
        additional team in BottomPanel, which would be used in ItemsExchange
        state and would include Trash)

(-) Game speed
    (-) Possibility to change game speed (useful on newer machines, where 
        vikings move terribly slowly)
        It is in options (-v) and vikings move quicker then, 
        but not the monsters!
    (-) Increase default game speed
    (-) Code (option-switchable) which tests for highest possible game speed
        at given frame rate

(-) Vikings remember the surface they are standing on so that it isn't 
    necessary to check for fall in every iteration of frame cycle

(-) Make compiled version of SchwerEngine::Rectangle (Profiling told me that
    program spends 
	14% of time in Rectangle#at (2530 calls), 
	8% in Rectangle#left (1272 calls)
	7% in Rectangle#collides (172 calls))
	etc.

(-) Pause game on focus loss (should be just option -
    it spares cpu time, but someone may not want this behavior)

(-) Support for "tileset images" into "poor fV XML maps"?

(-) Redesign VikingState (current design is pretty useless and immature)

(-) [GO] LivingStone - animate all frames properly, finish code

(-) [DOC] Create manpage of freeVikings

(-) [UI] error in script is shown in kind of dialog window

(-) Viking's rect isn't constant, but may have variable size and
    is dependent on image used (display rect defined in model file
    for every image?)

(-) Entity#init_images should be something like protected (I don't know 
    exactly what 'protected' means IN RUBY; maybe it should be even private
    and called using instance_eval)

(-) Transporter tasks
    (-) Transporter: Transporter doesn't search for Transportables,
        but vice versa: Transportables register at the Transporter when 
        they find him
    (-) Transporter#update_transported_sprites: less cycles

(-) Clean up SchwerEngine: some better configuration then through global 
    constant GFX_DIR etc.

(-) [VI] Better - more realistic - physics (jumping etc.)

(-) Set up some check for new releases of libraries we are using
    (RUDL, script, Log4r, REXML)

(-) Variable number of heroes (from 1 up to 4?); more heroes
    (aside of Fang and Scorch from Lost Vikings 2 I would like to add at least
    one totally new hero - Olaf's wife Hildegard);
    Heroes are defined in location.xml; possibility to modify team on-the-fly
    from inside level

(-) [UI] Add some "dead animation" on level restart

(-) Move all requirement stuff to one file (freevikings.rb), so that it can be 
    controlled easily

(-) Remove StaticObject#unregister_in;
    instead, add Entity#unregister (without argument, every Entity will have
    reference of the Location)

(-) [UI] Show level name, description and author at the beginning of level

(-) release tool: add task: mail to freevikings-users mailing list

(-) release tool: option -P to checkout (ommit empty directories)

(-) Map's borders are solid, so it is impossible to go out of the map

(-) File.open in the script should receive address relative to level directory

(-) [GO] Some teleporting animation
    (It's possible to implement it as a Sprite,   e.g. Teleport::Animation)

(-) Possibility to define starting point for each viking separately

(-) Game objects which weren't given any theme should wait till they are
    registered in a location and try to get it's theme - not raise exception

(-) Move all items to a separate directory items/ ?

(-) Installation

(-) Skinnable vikings

(-) [DT] Complex tutorial level set

(-) developer's manual: finish level tutorial

(-) RDoc documentation (convert RD to RDoc)

(-) Items autouse (healing items mainly) as in LV2 (only as option)

(-) Repair RUDL:  Music.post_end_event shouldn't require argument
    and event should be sent if set to true and music ends

(-) release tool: add task: post file to SF

======== Funny but useless features ====================================

(-) When doing nothing vikings show how much they are bored. After cca ten
    minutes they fall asleep. From time to time they wake up, say something
    and fall asleep again.

(-) Voice of Thor

============= TASK TYPE CODES:

[GO] game objects
[VI] vikings
[UI] user interface and related stuff
[DT] data (maps, pictures, scripts, ...)
