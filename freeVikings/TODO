           ===========================================
           ========== FreeVikings TODO file ==========
           ===========================================

======== RubyCampaign ==================================================

(-) Intro should be on the coast of the sea and not in house.
    Create another map.

(-) Repair Assembler tileset (the black stripes are awful!)

(-) Finish Assembler level

======== Graphics ======================================================

(-) Some image for teleport (cca 80x120px)

======== Code ==========================================================

(-) Jump one level up in menu also by Esc (not only hitting QuitButton)

(-) Remove unused class World (world.rb) - it is inherited by StructuredWorld -
    so be carefull!

(-) Music

(-) Fix bug "not displayed first row of tiles"
    (See schwerengine/map.rb L75; find a similar thing in painting of
    game objects; remove both)

(-) Map's borders are solid, so it is impossible to go out of the map

(-) Fix wrong displaying of map's last row

(-) Some teleporting animation
    (It's possible to implement it as a Sprite, e.g. Teleport::Animation)

(-) Enable hard reloading (not only restart game, but also reload
    map and script)

(-) Vikings should rest on Olaf's shield only if it's over his head

(-) Show level name, description and author at the beginning of level

(-) Delete items using mouse: drag item and drop it over trash icon

(-) Visual drag&drop of items; highlighting

(-) Bomb

(-) Smashable wall (bomb/Erik's head)

(-) Erik's 'head-smash' feature

(-) Possibility to define starting point for each viking separately

(-) User's (and system?) configuration file (with possibility to define
    multiple location storage places)

(-) Possibility to change keys (movement, inventory control etc.)

(-) Variable tile size (not only 40x40)

(-) Move all items to a separate directory items/ ?

(-) Repair the Snail (this monster seems to be out of order)

(-) Make all setup stuff accessible from the menu (e.g. define location 
    storage places, choose a campaign to be played etc.)

(-) Possibility to change game speed (useful on newer machines, where 
    vikings move terribly slowly)
    It is in options (-v) and vikings move quicker then, but not the monsters!

(-) Installation

(-) Skinnable vikings

(-) Complex tutorial level set

(-) User's manual

(-) Level developer's manual

(-) RDoc documentation (convert RD to RDoc)

(-) Animated loading (e.g. some efects on the word "LOADING" or a progress bar)

(-) Items autouse (healing items mainly) as in LV2
