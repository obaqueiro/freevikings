           ========== FreeVikings TODO file ==========
           ===========================================

======== RubyCampaign ==================================================

======== Graphics ======================================================

(-) Full spritesheets for all three vikings according to the developers'
    manual

(-) Image for unactive teleport

======== Code ==========================================================

(-) Fix BottomPanel
    (-) active viking has coloured portrait
    (-) selection box shows differently according to the state
    (-) participating vikings are displayed differently during exchange
    (-) implement trash in a new way (not as a fake viking)

(-) Christmas bonus level(set?)

(-) Fix error "Erik can jump very high pressing Space again and again"

(-) Fix error "Erik can't jump when he is walking"

(-) Add z coordinate to game objects (so that their placement can be better
    controlled - some objects might want to be before vikings;
    other ones want to be behind some other objects, ...)
    (Very important now, because Shield is often hidden behind other
    Static objects)

(-) [GO] Ladder
    (-) Vikings can climb

(-) Vikings remember the surface they are standing on so that it isn't 
    necessary to check for fall in every iteration of frame cycle

(-) Make compiled version of SchwerEngine::Rectangle (Profiling told me that
    program spends 
	14% of time in Rectangle#at (2530 calls), 
	8% in Rectangle#left (1272 calls)
	7% in Rectangle#collides (172 calls))
	etc.

(-) Support for "Tiled tilesets" into "poor fV XML maps"?

(-) Redesign VikingState (current design is pretty useless and immature)

(-) Wall/monster-smashing feature
    (-) [VI] Erik's 'head-smash' feature (depends on rewriting VikingState -
             whole design of VikingState must be changed, because
             vertical and horizontal state can't be so much "standalone" -
             it leads to unknown states etc.)
    (-) bomb's flame can't reach behind wall or shield
    (-) Dropped bomb stops on a shield

(-) [UI] Menu / configuration issues:
    (-) Menu scrolls if it is too long
    (-) Menu: add a message if a bad password is given (also to the GUI,
        not only to a console)
    (-) Possibility to change keys (movement, inventory control etc.)
    (-) User's (and system?) configuration file (with possibility 
        to define multiple location storage places)
    (-) define location storage places, choose a campaign to be played

(-) [GO] Olaf's van: all vikings can be inside but just Olaf can drive it;
    it only moves when it has enough fuel; it has attributes similar to Olaf
    (vikings can stay on it's deck; monsters can't pass through it)

(-) [UI] error in script is shown in kind of dialog window

(-) [UI] During drag&drop highlight vikings which can receive item

(-) Viking's rect isn't constant, but may have variable size and
    is dependent on image used (display rect defined in model file
    for every image?)

(-) Support for spritesheets

(-) Entity#init_images should be something like protected (I don't know 
    exactly what 'protected' means IN RUBY; maybe it should be even private
    and called using instance_eval)

(-) Transporter tasks
    (-) Transporter: Transporter doesn't search for Transportables,
        but vice versa: Transportables register at the Transporter when 
        they find him
    (-) Transporter#update_transported_sprites: less cycles

(-) Clean up SchwerEngine: some better configuration then through global 
    constant GFX_DIR etc.

(-) [VI] Better - more realistic - physics (jumping etc.)

(-) Set up some check for new releases of libraries we are using
    (RUDL, script, Log4r, REXML)

(-) [UI] Add dialog "Back to menu/Restart level/Cancel"

(-) Variable number of heroes (from 1 up to 4?); more heroes
    (aside of Fang and Scorch from Lost Vikings 2 I would like to add at least
    one totally new hero - Olaf's wife Hildegard);
    Heroes are defined in location.xml; possibility to modify team on-the-fly
    from inside level

(-) [UI] Add some "dead animation" on level restart

(-) Shield tasks:
    (-) [VI] Olaf's shield shouldn't move awfully when Olaf's too quick
    (-) [VI] Vikings should rest on Olaf's shield only if it's over his head

(-) Move all requirement stuff to one file (freevikings.rb), so that it can be 
    controlled easily

(-) Remove StaticObject#unregister_in;
    instead, add Entity#unregister (without argument, every Entity will have
    reference of the Location)

(-) [UI] Show level name, description and author at the beginning of level

(-) release tool: add task: mail to freevikings-users mailing list

(-) Map's borders are solid, so it is impossible to go out of the map

(-) File.open in the script should receive address relative to level directory

(-) [GO] Some teleporting animation
    (It's possible to implement it as a Sprite,   e.g. Teleport::Animation)

(-) Possibility to define starting point for each viking separately

(-) Game objects which weren't given any theme should wait till they are
    registered in a location and try to get it's theme - not raise exception

(-) Move all items to a separate directory items/ ?

(-) Possibility to change game speed (useful on newer machines, where 
    vikings move terribly slowly)
    It is in options (-v) and vikings move quicker then, but not the monsters!

(-) Installation

(-) Skinnable vikings

(-) [DT] Complex tutorial level set

(-) developer's manual: finish level tutorial

(-) RDoc documentation (convert RD to RDoc)

(-) Items autouse (healing items mainly) as in LV2 (only as option)

(-) Repair RUDL:  Music.post_end_event shouldn't require argument
    and event should be sent if set to true and music ends

(-) release tool: add task: post file to SF

============= TASK TYPE CODES:

[GO] game objects
[VI] vikings
[UI] user interface and related stuff
[DT] data (maps, pictures, scripts, ...)
